        | `acknowledged`                  | ACKNOWLEDGED           | A Product Order has been received by the Seller and has passed basic validation. A `productOrder.id` is assigned in the `acknowledged` state and a response is returned to the Buyer. The Product Order remains in the `acknowledged` state while validations of Product Order and Product Order Item(s) attributes as applicable is completed. If the Product Order and Product Order Item attributes are validated the Product Order moves to the `inProgress` state. If not validated, the Product Order moves to the `rejected` state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
        | `assessingCancellation`         | ASSESSING_CANCELLATION | A Cancel Product Order request has been received by the Seller. The Product Order is being assessed to determine if the Product Order can be cancelled. If there are charges associated with cancelling the Product Order, these are communicated to the Buyer using the Charge process. The Product Order remains in the `assessingCancellation` state until any relevant Charge is completed or withdrawn by the Seller. Once the Buyer's request has been validated and any associated Charges completed, the Product Order moves to the `pendingCancellation` state. If the request is not validated or if any associated Charges are not completed, the Product Order moves to the `inProgress` state and the Product Order is not cancelled.                                       |
        | `held.assessingCharge`          | ASSESSING_CHARGE       | A Charge has been initiated by the Seller that is not the result of a Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date or Cancel Product Order request and the Seller is awaiting a Buyer response to the Charge. If a blocking or non-blocking charge is accepted by the Buyer, the Product Order moves to `inProgress`. If a non-blocking charge is declined by the Buyer, the Product Order moves to `inProgress`. If a blocking charge is declined by the Buyer and there are no unrelated Product Order Items in the Product Order, the Product Order moves to the `inProgress` and then to the `failed` state. If a blocking charge is declined by the Buyer and there are unrelated Product Order Items in the Product Order, the Product Order moves to the `inProgress` state. |
        | `pending.assessingModification` | ASSESSING_MODIFICATION | A request has been made by the Buyer to modify either the `expediteIndicator` or the `requestedCompletionDate` of a Product Order Item. The Product Order Item is currently being assessed to determine whether the Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date is valid. If there is a charge associated with the Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date, the Product Order remains in the `pending.assessingModification` state until the Charge is completed or withdrawn by the Seller. Once the Buyer's request has been validated and any associated Charges completed, the Product Order returns to the `inProgress` state.                                                                                                                                      |
        | `cancelled`                     | CANCELLED              | The Product Order has been successfully cancelled.
