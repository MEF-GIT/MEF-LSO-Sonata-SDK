    **This specification represents MEF work in progress and is subject to
    change.** 


    The scope of this MEF API is to provide the ability for a Service
    Provider's (Buyer)

    operational support system to retrieve from a Partner's (Seller) Inventory
    management

    system a set of product instances based upon a filter of product inventory
    attributes,

    or a specific product instance based upon a product identifier.


    Product Inventory API has been designed by MEF basing on TMF 637 v4.0.0
