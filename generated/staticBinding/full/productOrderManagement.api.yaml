        BGP peers.

        - NO_EXPORT: When a No-Export community is attached to a route, the

        peers.

        - LOCAL_AS: To avoid any BGP routing loops, there is an important rule
        regarding the internal BGP neighbors: an IBGP neighbor cannot advertise
        a route to an IBGP neighbor if it received that route from another IBGP
        neighbor.

        - GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN: The Graceful SHUTDOWN (65535:0) community is used
        to smoothly shut down paths a router might use when its peer router is
        about to be intentionally shut down.

        - EXTENDED: An Extended community is an 8-byte value that is divided
        into two main sections:An extended community has three fields: type,
        administrator, assigned number (type:administrator:assigned-number).
        Based on the value of the high-order byte in the Type field, the
        administrator field can be an AS or an IP address.

        - ROUTE_TARGET: The Route Target community is used in MPLS VPN
        environments to separate two customers routing tables.

        - ROUTE_ORIGIN: In an MPLS VPN environment, the route origin community
        is used to identify where routes originated from, so that
        readvertisement back to that site is avoided.

        - LARGE: A Large community is a 12-byte BGP community that was developed
        when the 4-byte AS began to be allocated. Since each of the standard or
        extended communi-ties use 2-byte values for the AS, a 4-byte AS would
        not fit into the standard 2-byte value.

        | `acknowledged`        | ACKNOWLEDGED  | A Product Order Item has been
        received and has passed basic business validations. From the
        `acknowledged` state the Product Order Item is further validated and
        depending on the results of the validation and if other Product Order
        Items in the Product Order are also validated the Product Order Item
        moves to `inProgress`, `rejected.validated`, or
        `rejected.unassessed`.

        | `failed`              | FAILED        | The fulfillment of a Product
        Order Item has failed. A Product Order Item may fail because the Buyer
        declined a Blocking charge identified via the Charge, the Buyer failed
        to respond to a Charge Item included in a Charge, or the Seller is
        unable to fulfill the Product Order Item. A Product Order Item moving to
        `failed` state results in the Product Order State being `failed` or
        `partial`. This is a terminal
        state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
        |

        | `held`                | HELD          | The Product Order Item cannot
        be progressed due to Charge the Seller awaiting a response from the
        Buyer on a Charge. The Seller stops work on the Product Order Item until
        the Charge has completed. Upon acceptance by the Buyer of all Blocking
        charges, the Product Order Item returns to `inProgress` state If the
        Buyer rejects a Blocking charge, the Product Order Item moves to the
        `failed`
        state.

        | `inProgress`          | IN_PROGRESS   | The Product Order Item has
        been successfully validated and fulfillment has started. If the Seller's
        system links validation between Product Order Items in a Product Order,
        a Product Order Item in this state also indicates that the other Product
        Order Items passed
        validation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             
        |

        | `pending`             | PENDING       | The Product Order Item cannot
        be progressed due to the Seller assessing a Cancel Product Order or
        Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date request. The Seller
        stops work on the Product Order Item until either the Cancel Product
        Order has been accepted and the Product Order state moves to
        `pendingCancellation` and the Product Order Item state moves to
        `cancelled`, the Cancel Product Order has been rejected and the Product
        Order Item State moves to `inProgress`, the Modify Product Order Item
        Requested Delivery Date has been accepted and the Product Order Item
        State moves to `inProgress`, or the Modify Product Order Item Requested
        Delivery Date moves to `done.declined` and the Product Order Item state
        moves to `inProgress` with original delivery dates. |

        | `rejected`            | REJECTED      | A Product Order Item was
        submitted, and it has failed at least one validation checks the Seller
        performs during the `acknowledged`
        state.

        | `acknowledged`                  | ACKNOWLEDGED           | A Product
        Order has been received by the Seller and has passed basic validation. A
        `productOrder.id` is assigned in the `acknowledged` state and a response
        is returned to the Buyer. The Product Order remains in the
        `acknowledged` state while validations of Product Order and Product
        Order Item(s) attributes as applicable is completed. If the Product
        Order and Product Order Item attributes are validated the Product Order
        moves to the `inProgress` state. If not validated, the Product Order
        moves to the `rejected`
        state.

        | `assessingCancellation`         | ASSESSING_CANCELLATION | A Cancel
        Product Order request has been received by the Seller. The Product Order
        is being assessed to determine if the Product Order can be cancelled. If
        there are charges associated with cancelling the Product Order, these
        are communicated to the Buyer using the Charge process. The Product
        Order remains in the `assessingCancellation` state until any relevant
        Charge is completed or withdrawn by the Seller. Once the Buyer's request
        has been validated and any associated Charges completed, the Product
        Order moves to the `pendingCancellation` state. If the request is not
        validated or if any associated Charges are not completed, the Product
        Order moves to the `inProgress` state and the Product Order is not
        cancelled.                                       |

        | `held.assessingCharge`          | ASSESSING_CHARGE       | A Charge
        has been initiated by the Seller that is not the result of a Modify
        Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date or Cancel Product Order
        request and the Seller is awaiting a Buyer response to the Charge. If a
        blocking or non-blocking charge is accepted by the Buyer, the Product
        Order moves to `inProgress`. If a non-blocking charge is declined by the
        Buyer, the Product Order moves to `inProgress`. If a blocking charge is
        declined by the Buyer and there are no unrelated Product Order Items in
        the Product Order, the Product Order moves to the `inProgress` and then
        to the `failed` state. If a blocking charge is declined by the Buyer and
        there are unrelated Product Order Items in the Product Order, the
        Product Order moves to the `inProgress` state. |

        | `pending.assessingModification` | ASSESSING_MODIFICATION | A request
        has been made by the Buyer to modify either the `expediteIndicator` or
        the `requestedCompletionDate` of a Product Order Item. The Product Order
        Item is currently being assessed to determine whether the Modify Product
        Order Item Requested Delivery Date is valid. If there is a charge
        associated with the Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date,
        the Product Order remains in the `pending.assessingModification` state
        until the Charge is completed or withdrawn by the Seller. Once the
        Buyer's request has been validated and any associated Charges completed,
        the Product Order returns to the `inProgress`
        state.
