    **This specification represents MEF work in progress and is subject to
    change.** 


    MEF LSO Sonata Quote API allows to manage quote request & completion
    management between **Seller** and **Buyer**.


    3 different types of quotes are managed:

    - **Budgetary**: A quote that is provided quickly and with very little
    analysis such that the Buyer can get an idea of how much the requested
    Product Offering could cost.  Monthly Recurring Charges and Non-Recurring
    Charges, if specified, are subject to change. 


    - **Firm - Subject to Feasibility Check**: A quote that is provided to the
    Buyer based on some, but not a complete, pre-order analysis.  At this stage,
    there is further analysis that the Seller can (and is willing) to undertake
    to provide a committed or firm price, but the Sell-er needs more time to
    complete this or the Seller may request that the Buyer use the Firm -
    Subject to Feasibility Check Quote to proceed to the Order process. Ordering
    may be possible based on the Firm - Subject to Feasibility Check Quote with
    some stipulations as to how cost identified during delivery is addressed.
    The Monthly Recurring Charges specified in the Quote Response are
    final.  Non-Recurring Charges specified in the Quote Response are subject to
    change.


    - **Firm**: A quote provided to the Buyer based on a pre-order analysis. All
    Monthly Recurring Charges and Non-Recurring Charges specified on a Firm
    Quote are committed.  A Firm Quote may expire at some date specified by the
    Seller.

        The Buyer requests a list of Quotes from the Seller based on a set of
        filter criteria (as described in MEF 80).  For each Quote returned, the
        Seller also provides a Quote Identifier that uniquely identifies this
        Quote within the Seller. The order of the elements returned to the Buyer
        is defined by the Seller (e.g. natural order) and does not change
        between the pages.

            Links Service Attribute is a list of 5-tuples of the form <id,
            physicalLink, synchronousEthernet, precisionTiming,
            demarcConnectorType>, with one list item for each physical link. The
            value of id is an identifier for the physical link. The value of
            physicalLink is the specific Ethernet physical layer type.
            synchronousEthernet indicates if synchronous Ethernet is used on the
            physical link and has the value Enabled or Disabled. The value of
            precisionTiming indicates if the Precision Time Protocol is used on
            the physical link and has the value Enabled or Disabled. The value
            of demarcConnectorType specifies the type of connector used. Note
            that the id and the physicalLink come from the
            CarrierEthernetPhysicalLink class.
