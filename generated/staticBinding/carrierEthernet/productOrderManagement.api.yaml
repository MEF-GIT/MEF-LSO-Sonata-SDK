If there are any charges associated with the Buyer's Cancel Request, the Seller initiates a Charge which communicates the related charges to the Buyer, the Product Order remains in the `assessingCancellation` state until the Charge is completed or withdrawn by the Seller. Once the cancellation assessment is complete, the Product Order moves to the `pendingCancellation` state.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

If a blocking or non-blocking charge is accepted by the Buyer, the Product Order moves to `inProgress`. If a non-blocking charge is declined by the Buyer, the Product Order moves to `inProgress`. If a blocking charge is declined by the Buyer and there are no unrelated Product Order Items in the Product Order, the Product Order moves to the FAILED state. If a blocking charge is declined by the Buyer and there are unrelated Product Order Items in the Product Order, the Product Order moves to the `inProgress` state. |

If there is a charge associated with the Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date, the Product Order remains in the `pending.assessingModification` state until the Charge is completed or withdrawn by the Seller. Once the Buyer's request has been validated and any associated Charges completed, the Product Order returns to the `inProgress` state.                                                                                                       |

            Specifies the type (nature) of the relationship to the related Product. The nature of required relationships varies for Products of different types. For example, a UNI or ENNI Product may not have any relationships, but an Access E-Line may have two mandatory relationships (related to the UNI on one end and the ENNI on the other). More complex Products such as multipoint IP or Firewall Products may have more complex relationships. As a result, the allowed and mandatory `relationshipType` values are defined in the Product Specification.
