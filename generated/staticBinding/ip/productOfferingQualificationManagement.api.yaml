        This structure serves as a request for a product offering qualification item.
        A product qualification item is an individual article included in a POQ that describes a Product of a particular type (Product Offering) being delivered to the geographic address  or a service site specified by the Buyer.
        The objective is to determine if it is feasible for the Seller to deliver this item as described and for the Seller to inform the Buyer of the estimated time interval to complete this delivery.
        The modelling pattern introduces the `Common` supertype to aggregate attributes that are common to both `ProductOfferingQualificationItem` and `ProductOfferingQualificationItem_Create`. It happens that it is the Create type has a subset of attributes of the response type and does not introduce any new, thus the `Create` type has an empty definition.
