        | `acknowledged`        | ACKNOWLEDGED  | A Product Order Item has been received and has passed basic business validations. From the `acknowledged` state the Product Order Item is further validated and depending on the results of the validation and if other Product Order Items in the Product Order are also validated the Product Order Item moves to `inProgress`, `rejected.validated`, or `rejected.unassessed`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
        | `cancelled`           | CANCELLED     | The Product Order has moved to the `pendingCancellation` state.

        | `failed`              | FAILED        | The fulfillment of a Product Order Item has failed. A Product Order Item may fail because the Buyer declined a Blocking charge identified via the Charge, the Buyer failed to respond to a Charge Item included in a Charge, or the Seller is unable to fulfill the Product Order Item. A Product Order Item moving to `failed` state results in the Product Order State being `failed` or `partial`. This is a terminal state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
        | `held`                | HELD          | The Product Order Item cannot be progressed due to Charge the Seller awaiting a response from the Buyer on a Charge. The Seller stops work on the Product Order Item until the Charge has completed. Upon acceptance by the Buyer of all Blocking charges, the Product Order Item returns to `inProgress` state If the Buyer rejects a Blocking charge, the Product Order Item moves to the `failed` state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
        | `inProgress`          | IN_PROGRESS   | The Product Order Item has been successfully validated and fulfillment has started. If the Seller's system links validation between Product Order Items in a Product Order, a Product Order Item in this state also indicates that the other Product Order Items passed validation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
        | `pending`             | PENDING       | The Product Order Item cannot be progressed due to the Seller assessing a Cancel Product Order or Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date request. The Seller stops work on the Product Order Item until either the Cancel Product Order has been accepted and the Product Order state moves to `pendingCancellation` and the Product Order Item state moves to `cancelled`, the Cancel Product Order has been rejected and the Product Order Item State moves to `inProgress`, the Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date has been accepted and the Product Order Item State moves to `inProgress`, or the Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date moves to `done.declined` and the Product Order Item state moves to `inProgress` with original delivery dates. |
        | `rejected`            | REJECTED      | A Product Order Item was submitted, and it has failed at least one validation checks the Seller performs during the `acknowledged` state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

        | `acknowledged`                  | ACKNOWLEDGED           | A Product Order has been received by the Seller and has passed basic validation. A `productOrder.id` is assigned in the `acknowledged` state and a response is returned to the Buyer. The Product Order remains in the `acknowledged` state while validations of Product Order and Product Order Item(s) attributes as applicable is completed. If the Product Order and Product Order Item attributes are validated the Product Order moves to the `inProgress` state. If not validated, the Product Order moves to the `rejected` state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
        | `assessingCancellation`         | ASSESSING_CANCELLATION | A request has been made by the Buyer to cancel the Product Order and the Product Order is currently being assessed to determine whether it can be cancelled. If there are any charges associated with the Buyer's Cancel Request, the Seller initiates a Charge which communicates the related charges to the Buyer, the Product Order remains in the `assessingCancellation` state until the Charge is completed or withdrawn by the Seller. Once the cancellation assessment is complete, the Product Order moves to the `pendingCancellation` state.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
        | `held.assessingCharge`          | ASSESSING_CHARGE       | A Charge has been initiated by the Seller that is not the result of a Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date or Cancel Product Order request and the Seller is awaiting a Buyer response to the Charge. If a blocking or non-blocking charge is accepted by the Buyer, the Product Order moves to `inProgress`. If a non-blocking charge is declined by the Buyer, the Product Order moves to `inProgress`. If a blocking charge is declined by the Buyer and there are no unrelated Product Order Items in the Product Order, the Product Order moves to the FAILED state. If a blocking charge is declined by the Buyer and there are unrelated Product Order Items in the Product Order, the Product Order moves to the `inProgress` state. |
        | `pending.assessingModification` | ASSESSING_MODIFICATION | A request has been made by the Buyer to modify either the `expediteIndicator` or the `requestedCompletionDate` of a Product Order Item. The Product Order Item is currently being assessed to determine whether the Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date is valid. If there is a charge associated with the Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date, the Product Order remains in the `pending.assessingModification` state until the Charge is completed or withdrawn by the Seller. Once the Buyer's request has been validated and any associated Charges completed, the Product Order returns to the `inProgress` state.                                                                                                       |
