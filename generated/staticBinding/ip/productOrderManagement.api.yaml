        BGP peers.

        - NO_EXPORT: When a No-Export community is attached to a route, the
        router won't advertise the route to external peers--only to internal
        peers.

        - LOCAL_AS: To avoid any BGP routing loops, there is an important rule
        regarding the internal BGP neighbors: an IBGP neighbor cannot advertise
        a route to an IBGP neighbor if it received that route from another IBGP
        neighbor.

        - GRACEFUL_SHUTDOWN: The Graceful SHUTDOWN (65535:0) community is used
        to smoothly shut down paths a router might use when its peer router is
        about to be intentionally shut down.

        - EXTENDED: An Extended community is an 8-byte value that is divided
        into two main sections:An extended community has three fields: type,
        administrator, assigned number (type:administrator:assigned-number).
        Based on the value of the high-order byte in the Type field, the
        administrator field can be an AS or an IP address.

        - ROUTE_TARGET: The Route Target community is used in MPLS VPN
        environments to separate two customers routing tables.

        - ROUTE_ORIGIN: In an MPLS VPN environment, the route origin community
        is used to identify where routes originated from, so that
        readvertisement back to that site is avoided.

        - LARGE: A Large community is a 12-byte BGP community that was developed
        when the 4-byte AS began to be allocated. Since each of the standard or
        extended communi-ties use 2-byte values for the AS, a 4-byte AS would
        not fit into the standard 2-byte value.

        unable to fulfill the Product Order Item. A Product Order Item moving to

        | `acknowledged`                  | ACKNOWLEDGED           | A Product
        Order has been received by the Seller and has passed basic validation. A
        `productOrder.id` is assigned in the `acknowledged` state and a response
        is returned to the Buyer. The Product Order remains in the
        `acknowledged` state while validations of Product Order and Product
        Order Item(s) attributes as applicable is completed. If the Product
        Order and Product Order Item attributes are validated the Product Order
        moves to the `inProgress` state. If not validated, the Product Order
        moves to the `rejected`
        state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              
        |

        | `assessingCancellation`         | ASSESSING_CANCELLATION | A Cancel
        Product Order request has been received by the Seller. The Product Order
        is being assessed to determine if the Product Order can be cancelled. If
        there are charges associated with cancelling the Product Order, these
        are communicated to the Buyer using the Charge process. The Product
        Order remains in the `assessingCancellation` state until any relevant
        Charge is completed or withdrawn by the Seller. Once the Buyer's request
        has been validated and any associated Charges completed, the Product
        Order moves to the `pendingCancellation` state. If the request is not
        validated or if any associated Charges are not completed, the Product
        Order moves to the `inProgress` state and the Product Order is not
        cancelled.                                       |

        | `held.assessingCharge`          | ASSESSING_CHARGE       | A Charge
        has been initiated by the Seller that is not the result of a Modify
        Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date or Cancel Product Order
        request and the Seller is awaiting a Buyer response to the Charge. If a
        blocking or non-blocking charge is accepted by the Buyer, the Product
        Order moves to `inProgress`. If a non-blocking charge is declined by the
        Buyer, the Product Order moves to `inProgress`. If a blocking charge is
        declined by the Buyer and there are no unrelated Product Order Items in
        the Product Order, the Product Order moves to the `inProgress` and then
        to the `failed` state. If a blocking charge is declined by the Buyer and
        there are unrelated Product Order Items in the Product Order, the
        Product Order moves to the `inProgress` state. |

        | `pending.assessingModification` | ASSESSING_MODIFICATION | A request
        has been made by the Buyer to modify either the `expediteIndicator` or
        the `requestedCompletionDate` of a Product Order Item. The Product Order
        Item is currently being assessed to determine whether the Modify Product
        Order Item Requested Delivery Date is valid. If there is a charge
        associated with the Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date,
        the Product Order remains in the `pending.assessingModification` state
        until the Charge is completed or withdrawn by the Seller. Once the
        Buyer's request has been validated and any associated Charges completed,
        the Product Order returns to the `inProgress`
        state.

        | `cancelled`                     | CANCELLED              | The Product

    SlsRpPair:
      description: >-
        Service Level Specification Reference Point Pair. In a multipoint or
        rooted multipoint IPVC, performance objectives are ideally specified as
        applying between pairs of IPVC EPs - in other words, they apply to the
        performance that IP Data Packets experience as they flow from one EI to
        another. The SlsRpPair is a representation of this association.
