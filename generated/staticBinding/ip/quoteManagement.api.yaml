A Product Offering defines all of the commercial terms and, through association with a particular Product Specification defines all the technical attributes and behaviors of the Product. A Product Offering may constrain the allowable set of configurable technical attributes and/or behaviors specified in the associated Product Specification.
        The id of the Product offering is assigned by the Seller. The Buyer and the Seller exchange information about offerings' ids during the onboarding process.

        used while processing the request as defined in the Product Specification.
        The `groupingKey` attribute is used to achieve this behavior in the API by

More complex Products such as multipoint IP or Firewall Products may have more complex relationships. As a result, the allowed and mandatory `relationshipType` values are defined in the Product Specification.
