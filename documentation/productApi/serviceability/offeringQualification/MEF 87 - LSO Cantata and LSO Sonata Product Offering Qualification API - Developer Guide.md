# 4. Introduction

This standard specification document describes the Application Programming
Interface (API) for Product Offering Qualification functionality of the LSO
Cantata Interface Reference Point (IRP) and LSO Sonata IRP as defined in the
_MEF 55.1 Lifecycle Service Orchestration (LSO): Reference Architecture and
Framework_ [[MEF55.1](#8-references)]. The LSO Reference Architecture is shown
in Figure 1 with both IRPs highlighted.

![Figure 1: The LSO Reference Architecture](media/lsoArchitecture.png)
**Figure 1. The LSO Reference Architecture**

Cantata and Sonata IRPs define pre-ordering and ordering operations that allow
automated exchange of information between business applications of the the
Buyer (Customer or Service Provider) and Seller (Service Provider or Partner)
Domains. Those are:

- Product Catalog
- Address Validation
- Site Retrieval
- Product Offering Qualification
- Product Quote
- Product Inventory
- Product Ordering
- Trouble Ticketing
- Billing

The business requirements and use cases for Product Offering Qualification are
defined in:

- _MEF 79: Address, Service Site, and Product Offering Qualification Management
  Requirements and Use Cases_ [[MEF79](#8-references)],
- _MEF 79.0.1: Amendment to MEF 79: Address, Service Site, and Product Offering
  Qualification Management, Requirements, and Use Cases_
  [[MEF79.0.1](#8-references)], and
- _MEF 79.0.2: Amendment to MEF 79: Address Validation_
  [[MEF79.0.2](#8-references)].

This document focuses on implementation aspects of POQ functionality and is
structured as follows:

- [Section 4](#4-introduction) gives a technical introduction to POQ
  functionality.
- [Section 5](#5-api-description) provides an overview of the operations, data
  models, and design patterns of API definition.
- [Section 6](#6-api-interaction--flows) focuses on API interactions with the
  help of end-to-end sequence diagrams and usage examples.
- [Section 7](#7-api-details) complements Section 5 with an in-depth API
  description.

## 4.1. Description

The Product Offering Qualification (POQ) API allows a Buyer to check whether
the Seller can deliver a product or set of products from among their product
offerings at the geographic address or a service site specified by the Buyer;
or modify a previously purchased product.

The API payloads exchanged between a Buyer and the Seller during the POQ
execution consist of product-independent and product-specific parts. The
product-independent part is technically defined in this standard. The
product-specific part is defined in the product specifications of the concerned
product. Both definition types must be used in combination to validate the
correctness of the payloads.
[Section 5.2.3](#523-integration-of-product-specifications-into-product-offering-qualification-management-api)
explains how to use product-specific definitions with POQ API definition.

This document uses samples of Access E-Line Product specification definitions
to construct API payload examples in [Section 6](#6-api-interaction--flows).

**_Note:_** The Access E-Line product is valid only in the Sonata context. It
is used only for the explanation of the rules of combining the product-agnostic
(envelope) and product-specific (payload) parts of the APIs. The examples are
not normative and are not updated to reflect new version of the product
specification (MEF 106). It is out of the scope of this document to explain the
details of any product.

Product specifications are defined using JSON Schema (draft 7) standard
[[JS](#8-references)], whereas POQ API is defined using OpenAPI 3.0 standard
[[OAS-V3](#8-references)]. The payloads exchanged through POQ endpoints must
comply with these definitions as well as with MEF 79 [[MEF79](#8-references)],
MEF 79.0.1 [[MEF79.0.1](#8-references)], and MEF 79.0.2
[[MEF79.0.2](#8-references)] requirements for POQ functionality and with
product specifications that are in use.

## 4.2. Conventions in the Document

- Code samples are formatted using code blocks. When notation `<< some text >>`
  is used in the payload sample it indicates that a comment is provided instead
  of an example value and it might not comply with the OpenAPI definition.
- Model definitions are formatted as in-line code (e.g. `GeographicAddress`).
- In UML diagrams the default cardinality of associations is `0..1`. Other
  cardinality markers are complaint with the UML standard.
- In the API details tables and UML diagrams required attributes are marked
  with a `*` next to their names.
- In UML sequence diagrams `{{variable}}` notation is used to indicates a
  variable to be substituted with a correct value.

## 4.3. Relation to Other Documents

The requirements and use cases for POQ functionality are defined in MEF 79
[[MEF79](#8-references)], MEF 79.0.1 [[MEF79.0.1](#8-references)] and MEF
79.0.2 [[MEF79.0.2](#8-references)]. The API definition builds on TMF 679
version 19.0.1 [[TMF679](#8-references)]. POQ functions must allow using any
MEF product specifications.

## 4.4. Approach

As presented in Figure 2. both Cantata and Sonata API frameworks consists of
three structural components:

- Generic API framework
- Product-independent information (Function-specific information and
  Function-specific operations)
- Product-specific information (MEF product specification data model)

![Figure 2. Cantata and Sonata API framework](media/lsoApiStructure.png)

**Figure 2. Cantata and Sonata API framework**

The essential concept behind the framework is to decouple the common structure,
information and operations from the specific product information content.
Firstly, the Generic API Framework defines a set of design rules and patterns
that are applied across all Cantata or Sonata APIs. Secondly, the
product-independent part of the framework focuses on a model of a particular
Cantata or Sonata functionality and is agnostic to any of the product
specifications. For example, this standard is describing Product Offering
Qualification model and operations that allow performing qualifications of any
product that is aligned with one of MEF or custom product specifications.
Finally, the product-specific information part of the framework focuses on MEF
product specifications that define business-relevant attributes and
requirements for trading MEF subscriber and MEF operator services. This
standard is not defining MEF product specifications, however, can be used along
with any product specification defined by or compliant with MEF.

## 4.5. High-Level Flow

Product Offering Qualification is part of a broader Cantata and Sonata
End-to-End flow. Figure 3. below shows a high-level diagram to get a good
understanding of the whole process and Product Offering Qualification's
position within it.

![Figure 3. Cantata and Sonata End-to-End Flow](media/cantataSonataEndToEndFlowPoq.png)

**Figure 3. Cantata and Sonata End-to-End Function Flow**

- Address Validation:
  - Allows the Buyer to retrieve address information from the Seller, including
    exact formats, for addresses known to the Seller.
- Site Retrieval:
  - Allows the Buyer to retrieve Service Site information including exact
    formats for Service Sites known to the Seller.
- Product Offering Qualification (POQ):
  - Allows the Buyer to check whether the Seller can deliver a product or set
    of products from among their product offerings at the geographic address or
    a service site specified by the Buyer; or modify a previously purchased
    product.
- Quote:
  - Allows the Buyer to submit a request to find out how much the installation
    of an instance of a Product Offering, an update to an existing Product, or
    a disconnect of an existing Product will cost.
- Product Order:
  - Allows the Buyer to request the Seller to initiate and complete the
    fulfillment process of an installation of a Product Offering, an update to
    an existing Product, or a disconnect of an existing Product at the address
    defined by the Buyer.
- Product Inventory:
  - Allows the Buyer to retrieve the information about existing Product
    instances from Seller's Product Inventory.
- Trouble Ticketing:
  - Allows the Buyer to create, retrieve, and update Trouble Tickets as well as
    receive notifications about Incidents' and Trouble Tickets' updates. This
    allows managing issues and situations that are not part of normal
    operations of the Product provided by the Seller.

# 5. API Description

This section discusses the API structure and design patterns. It starts with a
description of available REST endpoints. Then, an overview of the API data
model is given together with the description of the extension design pattern
that is used to combine product-agnostic and product-specific parts of API
payloads. Finally, payload validation and API security aspects are discussed.

## 5.1. Resource/endpoint Description

### 5.1.1. Seller Side Endpoints

**Base URL for Cantata**:
`https://{{serverBase}}:{{port}}{{?/seller_prefix}}/mefApi/cantata/productOfferingQualification/v1/`

**Base URL for Sonata**:
`https://{{serverBase}}:{{port}}{{?/seller_prefix}}/mefApi/sonata/productOfferingQualification/v7/`

The following API endpoints are implemented by the Seller and allow the Buyer
to send POQ requests, retrieve existing POQs or POQ details, and manage
notification registrations. The endpoints and corresponding data model are
defined in
`productApi/serviceability/offeringQualification/productOfferingQualificationManagement.api.yaml`.

**[R1]** The Buyer implementation **MUST** be able to use all REST methods for
`/productOfferingQualification` endpoint that are listed in the table above.
[MEF79 R1].

### 5.1.2. Buyer Side Endpoints

**Base URL for Cantata**:
`https://{{serverBase}}:{{port}}{{?/buyer_prefix}}/mefApi/cantata/productOfferingQualificationNotification/v1/`

**Base URL for Sonata**:
`https://{{serverBase}}:{{port}}{{?/buyer_prefix}}/mefApi/sonata/productOfferingQualificationNotification/v7/`

The following API endpoints are implemented by the Buyer and are used by the
Seller to send POQ related notifications. The endpoints and corresponding data
model are defined in
`productApi/serviceability/offeringQualification/productOfferingQualificationNotification.api.yaml`

| API endpoint                             | Description                                                                | MEF 79 Use case Mapping          |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| `POST /listener/poqCreateEvent`          | A request initiated by the Seller to notify Buyer on POQ creation          | UC 9: Notify of POQ State Change |
| `POST /listener/poqStateChangeEvent`     | A request initiated by the Seller to notify Buyer on POQ state change      | UC 9: Notify of POQ State Change |
| `POST /listener/poqItemStateChangeEvent` | A request initiated by the Seller to notify Buyer on POQ Item state change | UC 9: Notify of POQ State Change |

### 5.1.3. Specifying the Buyer ID and the Seller ID

A business entity willing to represent multiple Buyers or multiple Sellers must
follow requirements of MEF 79 [[MEF79](#8-references)] chapter 8.8, which
states:

> For requests of all types, there is a business entity that is initiating an
> Operation (called a Requesting Entity) and a business entity that is
> responding to this request (called the Responding Entity). In the simplest
> case, the Requesting Entity is the Buyer and the Responding Entity is the
> Seller. However, in some cases, the Requesting Entity may represent more than
> one Buyer and similarly, the Responding Entity may represent more than one
> Seller.
>
> While it is outside the scope of this specification, it is assumed that the
> Requesting Entity and the Responding Entity are aware of each other and can
> authenticate requests initiated by the other party. It is further assumed
> that both the Buying Entity and the Requesting Entity know:
>
> a) the list of Buyers the Requesting Entity represents when interacting with
> this Responding Entity; and  
> b) the list of Sellers that this Responding Entity represents to this
> Requesting Entity.

In the API the `buyerId` and `sellerId` are represented as query parameters in
each operation defined in `productOfferingQualificationManagement.api.yaml` and
as attributes of an event (`PoqEvent`) as described in
`productOfferingQualificationNotification.api.yaml`.

**[R2]** If the Requesting Entity has the authority to represent more than one
Buyer the request **MUST** include `buyerId` query parameter that identifies
the Buyer being represented [MEF79 R80]

**[R3]** If the Requesting Entity represents precisely one Buyer with the
Responding Entity, the request **MUST NOT** specify the `buyerId` [MEF79 R81]

**[R4]** If the Responding Entity represents more than one Seller to this Buyer
the request **MUST** include `sellerId` query parameter that identifies the
Seller with whom this request is associated [MEF79 R82]

**[R5]** If the Responding Entity represents precisely one Seller to this
Buyer, the request **MUST NOT** specify the `sellerId` [MEF79 R83]

**[R6]** If `buyerId` or `sellerId` attributes were specified in the
notification registration request, the same attributes **MUST** be used in
notification payload.

## 5.2. Data Model - Key Entities

Sections below describe the most important entities (aka data types) from the
data model which can be found in the API specification (definitions section).
Each entity is a simple or composed type (using `allOf` keyword for data types
composition). A simple type defines a set of properties that might be of an
object, primitive, or reference type.

**[R7]** If an entity is used in the request or response payload all properties
marked as required **MUST** be provided.

A detailed description of the data types is provided in
[Section 7](#7-api-details) and the OpenAPI definition. The examples that
illustrate the usage of the data model are included in
[Section 6](#6-api-interaction--flows).

### 5.2.1 Request View on Key Entities

Figure 4 depicts a view on the data model that is used in the Product Offering
Qualification request (`POST /productOfferingQualification`) that is sent by a
Buyer (see [Section 5.1.1](#511-seller-side-endpoints) for details).

`ProductOfferingQualification_Create` is the root entity of a product offering
qualification request. It contains one or more
`ProductOfferingQualificationItem_Create`. An item
(`ProductOfferingQualificationItem_Create`) defines an item inquiry details (in
`MEFProductRefOrValue` structure) and allows for the definition of related
contact information (`relatedContactInformation`) or relations to other items
(`QualificationItemRelationship`). `MEFProductRefOrValue` allows for the
introduction of MEF product-specific properties to the POQ payload. The
extension mechanism is described in detail in
[Section 5.2.3](#523-integration-of-product-specifications-into-product-offering-qualification-management-api).
Also, a `MEFProductRefOrValue` may be used to specify relations to places
(using specializations of `RelatePlaceOrValue`) or/and to a product that exists
in the Seller's inventory (using `ProductRelationshipWithGrouping`).

![Data model - request view on key entities](media/key_entities_buyer.png)

**Figure 4. The POQ Management API Data model - request view on key entities**

### 5.2.2 Response/Inventory View on Key Entities

Figure 5 depicts a view on the data model that is used to provide a response to
a Buyer's Product Offering Qualification request
(`POST /productOfferingQualification`) or to retrieve POQ by an identifier
(`GET /productOfferingQualification/{{id}}`).

`ProductOfferingQualification` is the root entity of a product offering
qualification response and it is managed by the Seller.
`ProductOfferingQualification` extends `ProductOfferingQualification_Common`
(which represents Buyer's request) with a number of attributes, i.e. unique
identifier or state information.

**[R8]** The properties provided in the requests by the Buyer **MUST NOT** be
modified by the Seller.

`ProductOfferingQualification` contains one or more items
(`ProductOfferingQualificationItem`). For each item, the Seller provides the
processing state and if applicable the final response to a particular item from
Buyer's request.

**[R9]** In case of a successful response (`status` equals to `done.ready`) the
Seller **MUST** provide serviceability confidence level and if applicable might
provide an alternate product proposal (`AlternateProductOfferingProposal`).

**[R10]** If `status=done.ready`, and the `serviceabilityConfidence` is
`yellow` or `green`, the Seller **MUST** specify the `installationInterval` in
the response. [MEF79 R56]

**[O1]** If `status=done.ready`, then the Seller **MAY** specify the
`guaranteedUntilDate` in the response [MEF79 O5]

**Figure 5. The POQ Management API Data model - response/inventory view on key
entities**

### 5.2.3. Integration of Product Specifications into Product Offering Qualification Management API

Product specifications are defined using JsonSchema (draft 7) format and are
integrated into a POQ payload using TMF extension pattern.

The extension hosting type in API data model is `MEFProductConfiguration`. The
`@type` attribute of that type must be set to a value that uniquely identifies
the product specification. A unique identifier for MEF standard product
specifications is in URN format and is assigned by MEF. This identifier is
provided as root schema `$id` and in product specification documentation. Use
of non-MEF standard product definitions is allowed. In such case the schema
identifier must be agreed between the Buyer and the Seller.

The example below shows a header of a Product Specification schema, where
`"$id": urn:mef:lso:spec:sonata:access-eline:v1.0.0:poq` is the abovementioned
URN:

```yaml
'$schema': http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#
'$id': urn:mef:lso:spec:sonata:access-eline:v1.0.0:poq
title: MEF LSO Sonata - Access Eline OVC (POQ) Product Specification
```

Product specifications are provided as Json schemas without the
`MEFProductConfiguration` context.

Product-specific attributes can be introduced into `MEFProductRefOrValue`
(defined by the Buyer) or into `AlternateProductOfferingProposal` (may be
defined by the Seller while responding to POQ) using `MEFAlternateProduct`.
Each of these types introduces the `productConfiguration` attribute of type
`MEFProductConfiguration` which is used as an extension point for
product-specific attributes.

Implementations might choose to integrate selected product specifications to
data model during development. In such case an integrated data model is built
and product specifications are in inheritence relationship with
`MEFProductConfiguration` as described in OAS specification. This pattern is
called **Static Binding**. The SDK is additionally shipped with a set of API
definitions that statically bind all product-related APIs (POQ, Quote, Order,
Inventory) with all corresponding product specifications available in the
release. The snippets below present an example of a static binding of the POQ
API with a number of MEF product specifications, from both
`MEFProductConfiguration` and product specification point of view:

```yaml
MEFProductConfiguration:
  description:
    MEFProductConfiguration is used as an extension point for MEF specific
    product/service payload.  The `@type` attribute is used as a discriminator
  discriminator:
    mapping:
      urn:mef:lso:spec:sonata:AccessElineOvc:v1.0.0:poq: '#/components/schemas/AccessElineOvcPoq_v1.0.0'
      urn:mef:lso:spec:cantata-sonata:SubscriberUni:v1.0.0:poq: '#/components/schemas/SubscriberUniPoq_v1.0.0'
      urn:mef:lso:spec:cantata-sonata:EplEvc:v1.0.0:poq: '#/components/schemas/EplEvcPoq_v1.0.0'
      urn:mef:lso:spec:sonata:OperatorUNI:v1.0.0:poq: '#/components/schemas/OperatorUNIPoq_v1.0.0'
    propertyName: '@type'
  properties:
    '@type':
      description:
        The name of the type, defined in the JSON schema specified above, for
        the product that is the subject of the POQ Request. The named type must
        be a subclass of MEFProductConfiguration.
      type: string
```

```yaml
AccessElineOvcPoq_v1.0.0:
  allOf:
    - $ref: '#/components/schemas/MEFProductConfiguration'
    - description:
        OVC Service Attributes control the behavior observable at and between
        External Interfaces to the Carrier Ethernet Network (CEN). The
        behaviors are achieved by the Network Operator and the Operator's
        client (the Service Provider in this case) agreeing on the value for
        each of the Service Attributes.
```

Alternatively, implementations might choose not to build an integrated model
and choose different mechanism allowing runtime validation of product specific
fragments of the payload. The system is able to validate given product against
a new schema without redeployment. This pattern is called **Dynamic Binding.**

Regardless of chosen implementation pattern, the HTTP payload is exactly the
same. Both implementation approaches must conform to requirements specified
below.

**[R11]** `MEFProductConfiguration` type is an extension point that **MUST** be
used to integrate product specifications' properties into a request/response
payload.

**[R12]** The `@type` property of `MEFProductConfiguration` **MUST** be used to
specify the type of the extending entity.

**[R13]** Product attributes specified in payload must conform to the product
specification indicated by the `@type` property.

![Extension pattern](media/extension_pattern.png)

**Figure 6. The Extension Pattern with Sample Product Specific Extensions**

Figure 6. depicts two MEF `<<ProductSpecifications>>` that represent Access
E-Line and Operator UNI products. When these products are used in POQ payload
the `@type` of `MEFProductConfiguration` takes
`"urn:mef:lso:spec:sonata:AccessElineOvc:1.0.0:poq"` or
`"urn:mef:lso:spec:sonata:OperatorUNI:1.0.0:poq"` value to indicate which
product specification should be used to interpret a set of product-specific
attributes included in the payload.

The _poq_ suffix after the product type name in the URN comes from the approach
that the product schemas may differ depending on the Interface Reference Point
function they are used with.

## 5.3. Model Structural Validation

The structure of the HTTP payloads exchanged via POQ API endpoints is defined
using:

- OpenAPI version 3.0 for product-agnostic part of the payload
- JsonSchema (draft 7) for product-specific part of the payload

**[R14]** Implementations **MUST** use payloads that conform to these
definitions.

**[R15]** A product specification may define additional consistency rules and
requirements that **MUST** be respected by implementations. These are defined
for:

- relations to other items in the same product offering qualification request
  (e.g. required relation type, multiplicity) (as specified in [MEF79 R37],
  [MEF79 A1-R2])
- relations to entities from the inventory managed by the Seller (as specified
  in [MEF79 R37], [MEF79 A1-R1])
- related contact information that is to be defined at an item level
- relations to places (locations) that are to be defined at an item level
  [MEF79 R35 & R36]

## 5.4. Security Considerations

There must be an authentication mechanism whereby a Seller can be assured who a
Buyer is and vice-versa. There must also be authorization mechanisms in place
to control what a particular Buyer or Seller is allowed to do and what
information may be obtained. However, the definition of the exact security
mechanism and configuration is outside the scope of this document. It is being
worked on by a separate MEF Project (MEF W128).

# 6. API Interaction & Flows

This section discusses the most important aspects of end-to-end interactions
that result in completed product qualification inquiries. It starts with a
description of product specifications which are used in the remainder of the
section in example payloads. Then the end-to-end flows are presented for the
immediate and deferred interaction patterns. Next, the structure of the POQ
request and response is described. This part highlights different variants of
POQ interactions for different item action types, place definitions, and
alternative responses. Finally, the mechanism of notifications is briefly
discussed.

## 6.1. Sample Product Specification

The Sonata SDK contains draft product specification definitions, from which UNI
and Access E-Line are used in the payload samples in this section. In Celine
release they are located in the SDK package at:

`\productSchema\carrierEthernet\accessEline\poq\accessElineOvc.yaml`
`\productSchema\carrierEthernet\carrierEthernetOperatorUni\poq\carrierEthernetOperatorUni.yaml`

The product specification data model definitions are available as JsonSchema
(version `draft 7`) documents. Figure 7 and Figure 8 depict simplified UML
views on these data models in which:

- the mandatory attributes are denoted with `*`,
- the mandatory relations have a cardinality of `1` or `1..*`,
- some relations and attributes that are not essential to the understanding of
  the product specification model are omitted.

The red color in figures 7 and 8 below highlights the data model of Access
E-Line.

![Access ELine Product Specification Example](media/product_spec_AEL.png)

**Figure 7. A simplified view on Access E-Line product specification data
model**

![UNI Product Specification Example](media/product_spec_UNI.png)

**Figure 8. A simplified view on UNI product specification data model**

Product specifications define a number of product-related and envelope-related
requirements. Sample envelope-related requirements for Access E-Line:

- for an Access E-Line product two mandatory relationship roles must be
  specified, one with the operator ENNI (`ENNI_REFERENCE`) and a second with
  the operator UNI (`UNI_REFERENCE`) for `add` action. First must be realized
  as a product relationship (relation to product existing in Seller's
  Inventory), second might be realized as an poq item (being part of the same
  poq) or as a product relationship
- in the case of a `modify` action, product relationships must have the same
  value as in the `add` action. They must not be changed
- for an operator UNI product a place relationship (`INSTALL_LOCATION`) must be
  specified
- in the case of a `modify` action, place relationships must have the same
  value as in the `add` action. They must not be changed

The product relationship (`product.productRelationship`) and the place
relationship (`product.place`) are presented in Figure 4 and in more details at
Figure 13.

In case some of both product-related or envelope-related requirements are
violated the Seller returns an error response to the Buyer which indicates
specific functional errors. These errors are listed in the response body (a
list of `Error422` entries) for HTTP `422` response.

## 6.2. Interaction Patterns

To complete POQ inquiry three interaction patterns can be used depending on
Buyer/Seller side capabilities.

### 6.2.1. Immediate Response

Immediate response can be requested by a Buyer using `instantSyncQualification`
flag set to `true`. In case of successful processing, the Seller will respond
with POQ in state `done.ready` (indicating success) or
`terminatedWithError`(indicating that Buyer has not provided enough
information). Otherwise, the appropriate error code and description are
returned in case the payload doesn't pass initial validation. Please note that
`done.unableToProvide` state is not supported in the immediate response case.
The `done.unableToProvide` state is only used during the Deferred Response
pattern when the Seller is unable to provide a response in the time frame
required by the Buyer.

**_Note_**: The term "Seller Response Code" used in the Business Requirements
maps to HTTP response code, where `2xx` indicates _Success_ and `4xx` or `5xx`
indicate _Failure_.

**[R16]** The Seller **MAY** provide an immediate answer even when
`instantSyncQualification` flag set to `false` [MEF79 R3].

![Immediate response](media/iter_instant.png)

**Figure 9. Immediate response**

### 6.2.2. Deferred Response with Polling

A deferred response can be requested by a Buyer using
`instantSyncQualification` flag set to `false`. The Seller responds with
partial `POQ` (including at least `id` and `state=acknowledged`) and starts
processing the request asynchronously. The Buyer polls the POQ until the final
status is reached by the POQ using the POQ identifier specified by the Seller
in response.

![Deferred response with polling](media/iter_poll.png)

**Figure 10. Deferred response with polling**

### 6.2.3. Deferred Response with Notifications

In this variant of the deferred response, the notifications mechanism is used.
First, the Buyer registers for notification providing a callback endpoint. Then
the Buyer requests for qualification. The Seller sends notifications on POQ
creation and subsequent POQ and POQ Item State changes until the final POQ
status is reached.

When the Buyer registers for POQ notifications this registration will be valid
until the Buyer unsubscribes from the POQ notifications. This implies that for
any POQ request the Buyer sends to the Seller, and for which they request a
Deferred Response, in the time frame between the registration for the POQ
notifications and unsubscribing from the same POQ notifications by the Buyer,
the Seller will have to inform the Buyer of changes using the POQ
notifications.

![Deferred response with notifications](media/iter_hub.png)

**Figure 11. Deferred response with notifications**

## 6.3. Sending Product Offering Qualification Request

To send a POQ request a Buyer must use createProductOfferingQualification
(`POST {{baseUrl}}/productOfferingQualification`) which represents UC6 from
MEF79. In the remainder of this section, some of the POQ payloads attributes
might be omitted to simplify examples' content. The full list of attributes is
available in [Section 7](#7-api-details) and in API specification which is an
integral part of this standard.

### 6.3.1. Buyer POQ Request

The most common Buyer attributes used in a request are listed below:

```json
{
  "provideAlternative" : false,
  "requestedPOQCompletionDate" : "2020-08-29T07:03:36.2640125Z",
  "instantSyncQualification" : false,
  "projectId" : "ourProjectForCustomerX",
  "relatedContactInformation" : [],
  "productOfferingQualificationItem" : [ {
    "id" : "item-001",
    "action" : "add",
    "product": { << product specific attributes and configuration >> },
    "relatedContactInformation": [ << required related contact information entries >> ],
    "qualificationItemRelationship": [ << item level relationships >> ]
  },
  {
      "id": "item-002"
      <<rest of item-002 attributes are omitted>>
  }
  ]
}
```

**[R17]** Each POQ request sent by the Buyer **MUST** include at least one POQ
Item. [MEF79 R28]

**[R18]** The Buyer **MUST** set the `instantSyncQualification` flag to request
for an immediate or deferred response. [MEF79 R27]

**[R19]** The `requestedPOQCompletionDate` **MUST** be specified when
`instantSyncQualification=false`

**[R20]** The Related Contact Information list **MUST** contain an entry that
represents the Buyer Contact Information. [MEF79 R27]

**[R21]** When specifying the Buyer Contact Information the Buyer **MUST**
provide a `relatedContactInformation` entry with a
`role=buyerContactInformation`.

**_Note:_** During the onboarding the Seller may require to provide an
additional contact `role`.

**_Note:_** It is up to Seller's descretion on how to react in case the Buyer
provides a contact `role` that is not listed by this standard or agreed upon
during the onboarding. Preferably the Seller should return an error with a
message stating which `roles` are accepted. It may also be ignored

**[R22]** The Buyer **MUST** follow product specification related requirements
when specifying values for
`productOfferingQualificationItem.relatedContactInformation`.

**Note:** [MEF79 R27] specifies the attributes that must be provided by a Buyer
in the POQ request. The API model is not compatible with this requirement in
following way:

- `provideAlternative` defines a default `false` value in case it is not
  provided by the Buyer,
- `instantSyncQualification` defines a default `false` value in case it is not
  provided by the Buyer.

The Buyer can request alternative proposals (`provideAlternative=true`) in the
Create POQ request. In case the Seller cannot support the requested Product
Offering or Product Configuration, alternative Product Offerings which the
Seller does support can be included in the Create POQ response by the Seller.

### 6.3.2. Seller's Response to POQ Request

The Seller deferred response may look like this:

```json
{
  "id" : "1234-5678-9000",
  "href" : "{{baseUrl}}/productOfferingQualification/1234-5678-9000",
  "state" : "done.ready",
  "stateChange": [ << state change log >>],
  "expectedPOQCompletionDate" : "2020-08-06T18:45:33.228518Z",
  "provideAlternative" : false, << as provided by the Buyer >>
  "requestedPOQCompletionDate" : "2020-08-29T07:03:36.2640125Z", << as provided by the Buyer >>
  "instantSyncQualification" : false, << as provided by the Buyer >>
  "projectId" : "ourProjectForCustomerX", << as provided by the Buyer >>
  "relatedContactInformation" : [<< might be appended with contact information specific to the Seller >>],
  "productOfferingQualificationItem" : [ {
    "id" : "item-001",
    "state" : "done.ready",
    "stateChange": [ << state change log >> ],
    "serviceabilityConfidence": "green",
    "guaranteedUntilDate": "2020-11-06T18:45:33.228518Z",
    "installationInterval" : {
        "amount" : 10,
        "timeUnit" : "days"
    },
    "action" : "add",
    "product": { << as provided by the Buyer >> },
    "relatedContactInformation": [ << might be appended with contact information specific to the Seller >> ],

**[R23]** The Seller **MUST NOT** change the values of attributes specified by
the Buyer.

These attributes are indicated above with an appropriate comment. The Seller
might append related contact information, if required, either at item or POQ
level but cannot modify related contact information provided by the Buyer.

**[R24]** If the `ProductOfferingQualification` is used to provide a response
to an instant qualification request the `state` **MUST** take either
`terminatedWithError` or `done.ready` value. [MEF79 R45]

**[R25]** The Related Contact Information list **MUST** contain an entry that
represents Seller Contact Information [MEF79 R48 && R72].

**[R26]** When specifying the Seller Contact Information the Seller **MUST**
provide a `relatedContactInformation` entry with a
`role=sellerContactInformation`.

**[R27]** Each item in `productOfferingQualificationItem` list in the response
**MUST** correspond to an item from a list in the request [MEF79 R50 && R74].

**[R28]** When item state is `done.ready` the Seller **MUST** provide value for
`serviceabilityConfidence` [MEF79 R55 & R78] attribute.

**[R29]** When attribute `serviceabilityConfidence` is set to `green` or
`yellow` the Seller **MUST** provide values for `installationInterval`
attribute [MEF79 R56 & R79]

**[R30]** When item state is `terminatedWithError` or `done.abandoned` the

### 6.3.3. POQ Item Specification Details

**[R32]** For each item, the Buyer **MUST** specify `id`, `action`, and
`product`.

In the remainder of the section examples of POQ item definitions for different
`action` types are given.

#### 6.3.3.1. POQ Item Structure for `add` Action

The example below represents a single POQ request item
(`ProductOfferingRequestItem_Create`) to evaluate the installation of a new
(action `add`) Access E-Line product (type
`urn:mef:lso:spec:sonata:AccessElineOvc:1.0.0:poq`). A Buyer is sending all
mandatory attributes as well as a subset of optional attributes that are
relevant for this inquiry.

}
```

MEF 79 defines the `productOffering` as mandatory for the `add` action. This is
in the case the Buyer knows exactly what Product Offering to refer to in the
request. However, the API allows additionally the use case of providing the
`productSpecification` instead. In this scenario, the Buyer asks if a
particular type of product (defined by providing `productSpecification` and
additional product-specific attributes in `productConfiguration`) can be served
and gets back from the Seller a direct or alternate `productOfferings` in the
response. These can be later used in Quote and Product Order steps.

**[R33]** If `action=add` the Buyer **MUST** provide exactly one of
`productOffering` or `productSpecification`. [MEF79 R31]

**[R34]** If `action=add` the Buyer **MUST** provide product-specific
attributes (`productConfiguration`). [MEF79 R31]

**[R35]** The product specified in `product.@type` **MUST** be compatible with
the one defined by `productOffering` or `productSpecification`.

**[R36]** If `action=add` the Buyer **MUST NOT** provide `product.id`. [MEF79
R30]

In the example above, the Access E-Line product specification is identified as
`00000000-0000-0000-0000-0000000007e3` in the Seller's catalog. This
specification describes the structure and requirements defined for this product
which should be validated. An Access E-Line product specification defines two
mandatory relationship types that have to be specified in case of an `add`
action qualification: `ENNI_REFERENCE` and `UNI_REFERENCE`. The reference to an
operator UNI product might use another POQ item or an existing product from the
Seller's inventory. This example assumes that UNI product is another item of
the POQ request with a unique identifier `item-001`. This Access E-Line product
references an existing ENNI product that is uniquely identified with id
`00000000-0000-000a-0000-000000000001` in the Seller's inventory.

The place is not provided as Access E-Line product specification does not allow
for a place description to be part of the request. Values for some of the
available product attributes are provided under `productConfiguration` node.
This example uses a tiny subset of available Access E-Line attributes.

#### 6.3.3.2. POQ Item Structure for `modify` Action

The example below represents a single POQ request item to evaluate a
modification of an existing (action `modify`) Access E-Line product (type
`urn:mef:lso:spec:sonata:AccessElineOvc:1.0.0:poq`).

```json {.line-numbers}

              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  },

      "emailAddress": "john@mef.net",
      "role": "technical team",
      "name": "John Doe"
    }
  ]
}
```

**[R37]** The modify request **MUST** specify a reference (provide
`product.id`) to an existing product which is a subject of this order and
provide the desired `product.productConfiguration`. [MEF79 R32]

**[R38]** he modify request **MUST** repeat the same values (specified or
empty) of `product.productOffering`, `product.productRelationship`,
`product.productSpecification`, and `product.place` as they are for available
in the inventory for a given product instance. These values cannot be updated
nor deleted.

There is no possibility to send an update to single attributes. The Buyer must
send a full `product.productConfiguration` together with
`product.productRelationship` and `product.place` (if set), which means all
attributes that represent the desired state, even if some of them do not
change.  
If Seller does not allow for some of the attributes to change an appropriate
error response (`422`) must be returned to the Buyer.

The above example represents a qualification request for an Access E-Line
product change. In particular, changes to `cir` (Committed Information Rate)
values for `ENNI` and `UNI` bandwidth profiles are qualified. The Access E-Line
product exists in Seller's inventory and is identified as
`01494079-6c79-4a25-83f7-48284196d44d`.

**_Note:_** The Buyer can update a Buyer-related contact by providing a full
list of existing `relatedContactInformation` items, and updating the value
those with Buyer-related `roles`.

**_Note:_** The Buyer can not update a Buyer-related note. New notes can only
be appended to existing list of `note` items.

#### 6.3.3.3. POQ Item Structure for `delete` Action

The example below represents a single POQ request item to evaluate a disconnect
of an existing (action `delete`) Access E-Line product (type
`urn:mef:lso:spec:sonata:AccessElineOvc:1.0.0:poq`).

```json
{
  "id": "item-001",
  "action": "remove",
  "product": {
    "id": "01494079-6c79-4a25-83f7-48284196d44d"
  }
}
```

Product instance identifier (`01494079-6c79-4a25-83f7-48284196d44d`) is the
only allowed attribute in the disconnect evaluation request.

**[R39]** If `action=delete` the Buyer **MUST NOT** provide `productOffering`,
`productSpecification` and `productConfiguration` attributes. [MEF79 R33]

**[R40]** If item action is set to `modify` or `delete` the Buyer **MUST**
provide `product.id` of the referenced Product. [MEF79 R32]

**[R41]** In the `delete` request the only allowed attributes of `product` are
`id` and `@type`. [MEF79 R33]

### 6.3.4. Specifying Place Details

Some product specifications may define requirements concerning place definition
in case `add` or `modify` action is used. For example, the specification of a
place in the case of Access E-Line product is not allowed. Operator UNI product
specification requires an `INSTALL_LOCATION` place definition in case of `add`
action.

There are different formats in which place information may be provided:
geographic point (`MEFGeographicPoint`), fielded (`FieldedAddress`), formatted
(`FormattedAddress`), geographic address label (`GeographicAddressLabel`),
geographic site reference (`GeographicSiteRef`), and a geographic address
reference (`GeographicAddressRef`). Four of them can be used to provide a full
place description in POQ or POQ item. The site and address reference allow
specifying the place information as a reference to previously validated address
or site available through Seller's Address and Site API endpoints. To
distinguish between the place types the `@type` discriminator is used.

The superclass for all address types is the `RelatedPlaceRefOrValue` which add
the `role` to add more context to the specified address. To distinguish between
place types the `@type` discriminator is used.

**_Note:_** The _RefOrValue_ stands for a pattern where an address can be
provided either by `id` (using `GeographicSiteRef` or `GeographicAddressRef`)
OR by value (with use of `MEFGeographicPoint`, `FieldedAddress`,
`FormattedAddress`, `GeographicAddressLabel`). There is no way to specify an
address with use both ref AND value at the same time.

**[R42]** Buyer and Seller **MUST** support at least one of `FieldedAddress` or
`FormattedAddress` place representations [MEF79 R84 & R85].

**[R43]** `GeographicAddressRef` or `GeographicSiteRef` **MUST** be used to
provide place information by reference. This method is referred to as "Known
Address ID method" in MEF 79 Sn 8.9.3.1. [MEF79 D2]

Examples of different place specification formats are provided below.

#### 6.3.4.1. Fielded Address

```json
{
  "@type": "FieldedAddress",
  "streetType": "ul.",
  "streetName": "Edmunda Wasilewskiego",
  "streetNr": "20",
  "streetNrSuffix": "14",
  "city": "Kraków",
  "stateOrProvince": "Lesser Poland",
  "postcode": "30-305",
  "country": "Poland",
  "geographicSubAddress": {
    "levelType": "floor",
    "levelNumber": "4"
  },
  "role": "INSTALL_LOCATION"
}
```

Fielded address example of a place specification. The type discriminator has
the value `FieldedAddress`. A subset of available attributes is used to
describe the place. The fielded address has an optional `geographicSubAddress`
structure that defines several attributes that can be used in case precise
address information has to be provided. In the above example, a floor in the
building at the given address is specified using this structure. The role of
the place is assigned according to the requirements of the Operator UNI product
specification.

#### 6.3.4.2. Formatted Address

```json
{
  "@type": "FormattedAddress",
  "addrLine1": "ul. Edmunda Wasilewskiego 20/14",
  "city": "Kraków",
  "stateOrProvince": "Lesser Poland",
  "postcode": "30-305",
  "country": "Poland",
  "role": "INSTALL_LOCATION"
}
```

Place information in a form of a formatted address. The type discriminator has
the value `FormattedAddress`. This example contains the same information as
FieldedAddress example provided above, however, the detailed floor information
is omitted. The second address line (`addrLine2`) could be used to specify that
information.

#### 6.3.4.3. Geographic Point

```json
{
  "@type": "MEFGeographicPoint",
  "spatialRef": "EPSG:4326 WGS 84",
  "x": "50.048868",
  "y": "19.929523",
  "role": "INSTALL_LOCATION"
}
```

Place information in a form of geographic point. `spatialRef` determines the
standard that has to be used to interpret coordinates provided in the required
`x` (latitude), `y` (longitude), and optional `z` (elevation) values.

#### 6.3.4.4. Geographic Address Label

```json
{
  "@type": "GeographicAddressLabel",
  "externalReferenceType": "CLLI",
  "externalReferenceId": "PLTXCL01",
  "role": "INSTALL_LOCATION"
}
```

The Geographic Address Label represents a unique identifier controlled by a
generally accepted independent administrative authority that specifies a fixed
geographical location. The example above is a place that represents a CLLI
(Common Language Location Identifier) identifier which is commonly used to
refer locations in North America for network equipment installations.

#### 6.3.4.5. Geographic Site Reference

```json
{
  "@type": "GeographicSiteRef",
  "id": "18d3bb74-997a-4a62-8198-84250766765a",
  "role": "INSTALL_LOCATION"
}
```

`GeographicSiteRef` type is used to specify a `GeographicSite` by reference in
the POQ request. In the above example, a `GeographicSite` identified as
`18d3bb74-997a-4a62-8198-84250766765a` in the Seller's Service Site API is
used.

#### 6.3.4.6. Geographic Address Reference

```json
{
  "@type": "GeographicAddressRef",
  "id": "8198bb74-18d3-9ef0-4913-66765a842507",
  "role": "INSTALL_LOCATION"
}
```

`GeographicAddressRef` type is used to specify a `GeographicAddress` by
reference in the POQ request. In the above example a `GeographicAddress`
identified as `8198bb74-18d3-9ef0-4913-66765a842507` in the Seller's Service
Site API is used.

## 6.4. Retrieving POQ information

### 6.4.1. Retrieving POQ list

A Buyer can retrieve a list of the POQs by using
`GET /productOfferingQualification/` operation with desired filtering criteria.

The [[MEF79](#8-references)] specifies the possible filtering criteria, those
are **[MEF79 O7]**:

- `state`
- `projectId`
- `requestedPOQCompletionDate.lt`
- `requestedPOQCompletionDate.gt`

The Buyer may also ask for pagination with the use of the `offset` and `limit`
parameters. The filtering and pagination attributes must be specified in URI
query format [RFC3986](#8-references). Section
[7.1.2.](#712-response-pagination) provides details about the implementation of
the pagination mechanism.

The correct response (HTTP code `200`) contains a list of POQs matching the
criteria in the response body. In case, there are no POQs matching the criteria
an empty list is returned. MEF 79 [MEF79](#8-references) narrows the list of
POQ attributes that are populated in the response to:

- `id`,
- `state`,
- `requestedPOQCompletionDate`,
- `projectId`.

The Buyer may request to retrieve all POQ records that are associated with the
project `p1` by executing the following query:

`https://seller.com/mefApi/sonata/productOfferingQualification/v7/productOfferingQualification?projectId=p1`

In the response, the Seller returns all POQ matching these filtering criteria.

```json
[
  {
    "requestedPOQCompletionDate": "2020-09-18",
    "id": "97975e56-b6ba-40d4-b9b3-dab2b0e58279",
    "state": "inProgress",
    "projectId": "p1"
  },
  {
    "requestedPOQCompletionDate": "2020-09-26",
    "id": "79de3367-ce55-4e9a-952c-3c16e715bb7f",
    "state": "done.ready",
    "projectId": "p1"
  }
]
```

To see full details of a particular POQ the Buyer can retrieve POQ by the
identifier as described in the section below.

### 6.4.2. Retrieving POQ by identifier

POQ information can be retrieved from the Seller using GET
`/productOfferingQualification/{{id}}` operation. The correct payload returned
in the response includes all the attributes Buyer has provided while sending
POQ request. In case `id` does not identify a POQ that belongs to the Buyer an
error response `404` must be returned. A correct response includes at least POQ
unique `id` and up-to-date `state` assigned to POQ and all its items.

POQ can be in an intermediate (`inProgress`) or one of the final states
(`done.ready`, `done.unableToProvide` , or `terminatedWithError`). Details
about POQ structure and allowed POQ states are provided in
[API details section](#72-management-api-data-model).

```json
{
  "id" : "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b01",
  "href" : "{{baseUrl}}/productOfferingQualification/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b01",
  "state" : "done.ready",
   << some attributes are omitted >>
  "productOfferingQualificationItem" : [ {
    "id" : "item-001",
    "state" : "done.ready",
    "action" : "add",
    "serviceabilityConfidence" : "green",
    "guaranteedUntilDate" : "2020-12-23T12:00:00+02:00",
    << some attributes are omitted >>
    "stateChange" : [ {
      "changeDate" : "2020-08-23T21:13:32.20+02:00",
      "state" : "acknowledged"
    }, {
      "changeDate" : "2020-08-23T21:13:32.25+02:00",
      "state" : "inProgress"
    }, {
      "changeDate" : "2020-08-23T21:28:49.12+02:00",
      "state" : "done.ready"
    } ]
  } ],
  "stateChange" : [{
      "changeDate" : "2020-08-23T21:13:32.20+02:00",
      "state" : "acknowledged"
    }, {
    "changeDate" : "2020-08-23T21:13:32.25+02:00",
    "state" : "inProgress"
  }, {
    "changeDate" : "2020-08-23T21:28:50.25+02:00",
    "state" : "done.ready"
  } ]
}
```

In the above example, some of the attributes initially specified by the Buyer
are removed from the payload to make the example more concise. The POQ is in a
`done.ready` final state. This is only possible if all items are in the
`done.ready` state as well. The Seller's response to an inquiry represented by
id `item-001` is positive (serviceability confidence is `green`) and valid
almost end of 2020 (`guaranteedUntilDate`). In the state transition history
(`stateChange`) all transitions for an item and POQ are listed. As listed in
history the processing of the POQ request was almost instantaneous - completion
under 20 seconds.

## 6.5. Alternative Product Proposals

The Buyer may be interested in an alternative response in case the Seller is
not able to qualify an exact product. In that case, the Seller may respond with
a non-empty list of alternatives for each item with a confidence level assigned
to either `yellow` or `red`.

For example, a Buyer is requesting an option for an alternative response:

```json

{
  "provideAlternative" : true,
  "requestedPOQCompletionDate" : "2020-08-12T18:45:33.228518Z",
  "instantSyncQualification" : false,
  ...
}
```

As the Seller is not able to deliver the exact product, a single alternative is
returned:

```json
{
  "id" : "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b01",
  "href" : "{{baseUrl}}/productOfferingQualification/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b01",
  << some attributes are omitted >>
  "productOfferingQualificationItem" : [{
    "action" : "add",
    "id" : "item-001",
    "product" : {
      "productConfiguration" : {

                                },
                                << some attributes are omitted >>
                            }
                        ]

      }
    } ],
    << some attributes are omitted >>
    "state" : "done.ready"
  } ],
  << some attributes are omitted >>
}

```

The Seller is not able (`serviceabilityConfidence` is `red`) to deliver an
Access E-Line service with `cir` set to 20 Mbps. However, there is an option
for a service with `cir` of 30 Mbps. This response is returned as
`alternative-01`. The installation interval for the alternative offering is 10
days.

## 6.6. Notifications

Notifications are used to asynchronously inform the Buyer about:

- the creation of a `ProductOfferingQualification`,
- `ProductOfferingQualification.state` attribute value change,
- `ProductOfferingQualificationItem.state` attribute value change

Notifications are sent from Seller to Buyer in case:

- both Seller and Buyer support notification mechanism
- Buyer has registered to receive notifications from the Seller
- The state change notifications are sent only in the Deferred scenario as in
  the Immediate scenario once the response to POQ Request is provided (create
  notification), there will be no further state changes.
  ([Section 6.2.3.](#623-deferred-qualification-with-notifications))

To register for notifications Buyer can either register for all POQ
notifications:

```json
{
  "callback": "https://buyer.co/listenerEndpoint"
}
```

or be more selective using `query` attribute:

```json
{
  "callback": "https://buyer.co/listenerEndpoint",
  "query": "eventType=poqCreateEvent"
}
```

Seller sends notifications about POQ create and update events. Example of POQ
create event might look like:

```json
{
  "eventId": "event-001",
  "eventType": "poqCreateEvent",
  "eventTime": "2020-08-07T01:07:42.7030052+01:00",
  "event": {
    "id": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000b01"
  }
}
```

Notifications are sent to:

- `https://buyer.co/listenerEndpoint/mefApi/sonata/productOfferingQualificationNotification/v7/listener/poqCreateEvent`
  in case of `poqCreateEvent`
- `https://buyer.co/listenerEndpoint/mefApi/sonata/productOfferingQualificationNotification/v7/listener/poqStateChangeEvent`
  in case of `poqStateChangeEvent`
- `https://buyer.co/listenerEndpoint/mefApi/sonata/productOfferingQualificationNotification/v7/listener/poqItemStateChangeEvent`
  in case of `poqItemStateChangeEvent`

**[R44]** Seller **MUST** send events only to Buyers who have registered to
receive such notifications [MEF79 R58].

**[R45]** The create notifications **MUST** be sent in both Immediate and
Deferred scenarios [MEF79 R59].

**[R46]** The state change notifications **MUST** be sent only in the Deferred
scenario (there will be no state changes in the Immediate scenario anyway)
[MEF79 R59].

**_Note_**: MEF 79 defines only one type of the update event:
`poqStateChangeEvent` and specifies that both `Poq` and `PoqItem` state changes
notifications must be sent using this type. In other MEF APIs it is a common
pattern to separate the endpoint for Items to allow the Buyer to choose the
level of notifications and avoid unwanted messages. This pattern has also been
applied in POQ API.

# 7. API Details

## 7.1. API patterns

### 7.1.1. Indicating errors

Erroneous situations are indicated by appropriate HTTP responses. An error
response is indicated by HTTP status 4xx (for client errors) or 5xx (for server
errors) and appropriate response payload. The POQ API uses the error responses
depicted and described below.

Implementations can use HTTP error codes not specified in this standard in
compliance with rules defined in RFC 7231 [[RFC7231](#8-references)]. In such a
case the error message body structure might be aligned with the `Error`.

![Error response data model](media/error_entities.png)

**Figure 12. Data model types to represent an erroneous response**

#### 7.1.1.1. Type Error

**Description:** Standard Class used to describe API response error Not
intended to be used directly. The `code` in the HTTP header is used as a
discriminator for the type of error returned in runtime.

#### 7.1.1.6. Type Error422

The response for HTTP status `422` is a list of elements that are structured
using the `Error422` data type. Each list item describes a business validation
problem. This type introduces the `propertyPath` attribute which points to the
erroneous property of the request, so that the Buyer may fix it easier. It is
highly recommended that this property should be used, yet remains optional
because it might be hard to implement.

### 7.1.2. Response pagination

A response to retrieve a list of results (e.g.
`GET /productOfferingQualification`) can be paginated. The Buyer can specify
following query attributes related to pagination:

- `limit` - number of expected list items
- `offset` - offset of the first element in the result list

The Seller returns a list of elements that comply with the requested `limit`.
If the requested `limit` is higher than the supported list size the smaller
list result is returned. In that case, the size of the result is returned in
the header attribute `X-Result-Count`. The Seller can indicate that there are
additional results available using:

- `X-Total-Count` header attribute with the total number of available results
- `X-Pagination-Throttled` header set to `true`

**[R47]** Seller **MUST** use either `X-Total-Count` or
`X-Pagination-Throttled` to indicate that the page was truncated and additional
results are available.

## 7.2. Management API Data model

Figure 13 presents the Product Offering Qualification Management data model.
The data types, requirements related to them, and mapping to MEF 79 and MEF
79.0.1 specifications are discussed later in this section.

![POQ Management Data Model](media/key_entities.png)

**Figure 13. Product Offering Qualification Management Data Model**

The POQ Management data model is used to construct requests and responses of
the API endpoints described in [Section 5.1.1](#511-seller-side-endpoints)

### 7.2.1 Product Offering Qualification

#### 7.2.1.1. Type ProductOfferingQualification_Common

**Description:** Defines a set of POQ attributes that might be used by the
Buyer and cannot be modified by the Seller.

The `relatedContactInformation` entries provided by the Buyer cannot be changed

![POQ Activity Diagram](media/poq_activity.png)

**Figure 14. POQ Activity Diagram**

If a POQ request does not pass an initial validation the appropriate error
response is returned to the Buyer. In case a POQ request failed business rules
validation the HTTP response code is `422` and a list of validation problems is
returned. Otherwise, the POQ is assigned a unique identifier. In case of a
deferred response, the POQ gets the `acknowledged` state assigned and is
returned in the response. In case of an immediate response the POQ moves
directly to `done.ready` once the processing is done. POQ reaches `done.ready`
state if all elements are in `done.ready` state as well. If an evaluation of
any items concludes in state `terminatedWithError` the POQ reaches
`terminatedWithError` state. The `terminatedWithError` state is reached also
when there is some other information is missing in POQ request send by the
Buyer. If the POQ is processed asynchronously it can reach
`done.unableToProvide` if the Seller is not able to complete all items
qualification by the deadline specified by the Buyer
(`requestedPOQCompletionDate`).

**[R48]** The state of the POQ **MUST** be `done.ready` only if _all_ items are
in `done.ready` state [MEF79 R46 & R68].

**[R49]** The state of the POQ **MUST** be `terminatedWithError` only if _at
least one_ item is in `terminatedWithError` state [MEF79 R47 & R69].

**[R50]** The state of the POQ **MUST** be `inProgress` only if _at least one_
item is in `inProgress` state and _none_ of the items is in
`terminatedWithError` state [MEF79 R70].

#### 7.2.2.5. Type ProductOfferingQualificationItem_Create

<div id="T_ProductOfferingQualificationItem_Create"></div>

**Description:** This structure serves as a request for a product offering
qualification item.

A product qualification item is an individual article included in a POQ that
describes a Product of a particular type (Product Offering) being delivered to
the geographic address or a service site specified by the Buyer.

The objective is to determine if it is feasible for the Seller to deliver this
item as described and for the Seller to inform the Buyer of the estimated time
interval to complete this delivery.

The modeling pattern introduces the `Common` supertype to aggregate attributes
that are common to both `ProductOfferingQualificationItem` and
`ProductOfferingQualificationItem_Create`. It happens that it is the Create
type has a subset of attributes of the response type and does not introduce any
new, thus the `Create` type has an empty definition.

Figure 15. depicts an activity diagram for a POQ Item lifecycle.

![POQ Item Activity Diagram](media/poq_item_activity.png)

**Figure 15. POQ Item Activity Diagram**

The `acknowledged` is an initial internal state of an item. The item reaches
`inProgress` if the Buyer did not request instant qualification and the Seller
did not provide an immediate response. If there is any other item that reached
`terminatedWithError` state the currently processed item is abandoned
(`done.abandoned`). If the Seller was able to successfully complete the
processing of the item the `done.ready` state is assigned. Otherwise,
`terminatedWithError` state is assigned.

### 7.2.3. Product representation

#### 7.2.3.1. Type MEFProductRefOrValue

**Description:** Used by the Buyer to point to existing and/or describe the
desired shape of the product. In the case of `add` action - only
`productConfiguration` MUST be specified. For `modify` action - both `id` and
`productConfiguration` to point which product instance to update and to what
state. In `delete` only the `id` must be provided. Product-related properties

Definition of `place` and `productRelationship` must comply with specific
requirements of the Product Specification being used.

To indicate which Product Offering is used a Buyer may use a `productOffering`
attribute. MEF 79 defines the `productOffering` as mandatory for the `add`
action, however, the API allows additionally the use case of providing the
`productSpecification` instead. In this scenario, the Buyer asks if a
particular type of product can be served and gets back from the Seller a direct
or alternate `productOfferings` in response. These can be later used in Quote
and Product Order steps

#### 7.2.3.2. Type MEFProductConfiguration

**Description:** MEFProductConfiguration is used as an extension point for
MEF-specific product/service payload. The `@type` attribute is used as a
discriminator.

<table id="T_MEFProductConfiguration">
    <thead style="font-weight:bold;">

        </tr>
    </tbody>

_Repeated:_ **[R11]** `MEFProductConfiguration` type is an extension point that
**MUST** be used to integrate product specifications' properties into a
request/response payload.

_Repeated:_ **[R12]** The `@type` property of `MEFProductConfiguration`
**MUST** be used to specify the type of the extending entity.

_Repeated:_ **[R35]** The product specified in `product.@type` **MUST** be
compatible with the one defined by `productOffering` or `productSpecification.

[Section 7.2.2.2](#7222-enum-productactiontype) describes the relation between
product configuration attributes and an item action type specified by the
Buyer.

#### 7.2.3.3. Type ProductRelationshipWithGrouping

**Description:** A relationship to existing Product. The requirements for usage
for a given Product are described in the Product Specification. The
"WithGrouping" flavor of the Product Relationship allows for providing a list
of related product identifiers within a single Product Relationship. This can
be later used while processing the request as defined in the Product
Specification. The `groupingKey` attribute is used to achieve this behavior in
the API by marking the list of `ProductRelationshipWithGroupings` within a
`product` with a common key.

<table id="T_ProductRelationshipWithGrouping">
    <thead style="font-weight:bold;">

          relationships (related to the UNI on one end and the ENNI on the
          other). More complex Products such as multipoint IP or Firewall
          Products may have more complex relationships. As a result, the allowed
          and mandatory `relationshipType` values are defined in the Product
          Specification.</td>
            <td>Relationship Nature</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

MEF 79.0.1 allows for providing multiple related product identifiers. This can
be later used while processing the request as defined in the Product
Specification. The `groupingKey` attribute is to achieve this behavior in the
APIs.

**[R51]** The Product Identifier from relationships having the same
`groupingKey` and `relationshipType` **MUST** be treated as a list of
identifiers.

#### 7.2.3.4. Type AlternateProductOfferingProposal

### 7.2.5. Notification registration

Notification registration and management are done through `/hub` API endpoint.
The below sections describe data models related to this endpoint.

E.g. for &quot;callback&quot;: &quot;https://buyer.co/listenerEndpoint&quot;, the create event notification will be sent to: <code>https://buyer.co/listenerEndpoint/mefApi/sonata/productOfferingQualificationNotification/v7/listener/poqCreateEvent</code></td>

            <td>This attribute is used to define to which type of events to register to. Example: &quot;query&quot;:&quot;eventType = poqCreateEvent&quot;. To subscribe for more than one event type, put the values separated by comma: <code>eventType=poqCreateEvent,poqStateChangeEvent</code>. The possible values are enumerated by the <code>POQEventType</code> in productOfferingQualificationNotification.api.yaml. An empty query is treated as specyfying no filters - ending in subscription for all event types.</td>
            <td>List of Notification Types</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

The `query` formatting complies to RCF3986 [RFC3986](#8-references). According
to it, every attribute defined in the Event model (from notification API) can
be used in the `query`. However, this standard requires only `eventType`
attribute to be supported.

**[R53]** `eventType` is the only attribute that the Seller **MUST** support in
the query.

### 7.2.6. Common

#### 7.2.6.1. Type RelatedContactInformation

**Description:** Contact data for a person or organization that is involved in
the product offering qualification. In a given context it is always specified
by the Seller (e.g. Seller Contact Information) or by the Buyer.

Reference: MEF 79 (Sn 8.11)

<table id="T_RelatedContactInformation">
    <thead style="font-weight:bold;">
        <tr>
            <td>Name</td>
            <td>Type</td>
            <td>Description</td>
            <td>MEF 79</td>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>emailAddress*</td>
            <td>string</td>
            <td>Email address</td>
            <td>Contact email Address</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>name*</td>
            <td>string</td>
            <td>Name of the contact</td>
            <td>Contact Name</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>number*</td>
            <td>string</td>

            <td>Contract Phone Number</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>numberExtension</td>
            <td>string</td>
            <td>Phone number extension</td>
            <td>Contract Phone Number Extension</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>organization</td>
            <td>string</td>
            <td>The organization or company that the contact belongs to</td>
            <td>Contact Organization</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>role*</td>
            <td>string</td>
            <td>A role of the particular contact in the request</td>
            <td>Not represented in MEF 79</td>
        </tr><tr>
            <td>postalAddress</td>
            <td><a href="#T_FieldedAddress">FieldedAddress</a></td>
            <td>Identifies the postal address of the person or office to be contacted.</td>
            <td>Not represented in MEF 79</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

The related contact information can be defined at a POQ or a POQ Item level. In
both cases, it is allowed to provide a list of party role information. The
`role` attribute is used to provide a reason the particular party information
is used. It can result from MEF 79 requirements (e.g. Seller Contact
Information) or from the Product Specification requirements.

The rule for mapping a represented attribute value to a `role` is to use the
_lowerCamelCase_ pattern e.g.

- Seller Contact Information: `role=sellerContactInformation`
- Buyer Contact Information: `role=buyerContactInformation`

#### 7.2.6.2. Type Duration

**Description:** A Duration in a given unit of time e.g. 3 hours, or 5 days.

            <td>businessMinutes</td>
            <td>BUSINESS_MINUTES</td>   
        </tr>
