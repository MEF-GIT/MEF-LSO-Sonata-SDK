# 4. Introduction

This standard specification document describes the Application Programming
Interface (API) for Site Retrieval functionality of the LSO Cantata Interface
Reference Point (IRP) and Sonata IRP as defined in the MEF 55.1 _Lifecycle
Service Orchestration (LSO): Reference Architecture and Framework_
[[MEF55.1](#8-references)]. The LSO Reference Architecture is shown in Figure 1
with both IRPs highlighted.

![Figure 1: The LSO Reference Architecture](media/lsoArchitecture.png)
**Figure 1. The LSO Reference Architecture**

Cantata and Sonata IRPs define pre-ordering and ordering functionalities that
allow an automated exchange of information between business applications of the
Buyer (Customer or Service Provider) and Seller (Service Provider or Partner)
Domains. Those are:

- Address Validation
- Site Retrieval
- Product Offering Qualification
- Product Quote
- Product Inventory
- Product Ordering
- Trouble Ticketing
- Billing

The business requirements and use cases for Site Retrieval are defined in
_Address, Service Site, and Product Offering Qualification Management
Requirements and Use Cases_ (MEF 79) [[MEF79](#8-references)] and _Amendment to
MEF 79: Address Validation_ (MEF W79.0.2) [[MEF79.0.2](#8-references)].

This document focuses on implementation aspects of Site Retrieval functionality
and is structured as follows:

- [Chapter 4](#4-introduction) provides an introduction to Site Retrieval and
  its description in a broader context of Cantata and Sonata and their
  corresponding SDKs.
- [Chapter 5](#5-api-description) gives an overview of endpoints, resource
  model and design patterns.
- Use cases and flows are presented in
  [Chapter 6](#6-api-interactions-and-flows).
- And finally, [Chapter 7](#7-api-details) complements previous sections with a
  detailed API description.

## 4.1. Description

A Site usually represents a location where the Seller has already delivered one
or more products. A Site identifier is assigned at some point by the Seller to
reference the location. A Site may be reflected by one or more types of
addresses.

The point of Site Retrieval API is to allow the Buyer to retrieve details about
the location identified by a `GeographicAddress`.

## 4.2. Conventions in the Document

- Code samples are formatted using code blocks. When notation `<< some text >>`
  is used in the payload sample it indicates that a comment is provided instead
  of an example value and it might not comply with the OpenAPI definition.
- Model definitions are formatted as in-line code (e.g. `GeographicAddress`).
- In UML diagrams the default cardinality of associations is `0..1`. Other
  cardinality markers are complaint with the UML standard.
- In the API details tables and UML diagrams required attributes are marked
  with a `*` next to their names.
- In UML sequence diagrams `{{variable}}` notation is used to indicates a
  variable to be substituted with a correct value.

## 4.3. Relation to Other Documents

The requirements and use cases for Site Retrieval functionality are defined in
MEF 79 [[MEF79](#8-references)] and MEF 79.0.2 [[MEF79.0.2](#8-references)].
The API definition builds on TMF 674 API as specified by _TMF674 Geographic
Site Management API User Guide v4.0.1_ [[TMF674](#8-references)].

## 4.4. Approach

As presented in Figure 2. both Cantata and Sonata API frameworks consists of
three structural components:

- Generic API framework
- Product-independent information (Function-specific information and
  Function-specific operations)
- Product-specific information (MEF product specification data model)

![Figure 2. Cantata and Sonata API framework](media/lsoApiStructure.png)

**Figure 2. Cantata and Sonata API framework**

The essential concept behind the framework is to decouple the common structure,
information and operations from the specific product information content.  
Firstly, the Generic API Framework defines a set of design rules and patterns
that are applied across all Cantata or Sonata APIs.  
Secondly, the product-independent information of the framework focuses on a
model of a particular Cantata or Sonata functionality and is agnostic to any of
the product specifications.  
Finally, the product-specific information part of the framework focuses on MEF
product specifications that define business-relevant attributes and
requirements for trading MEF subscriber and MEF operator services.

The Site Retrieval is product-agnostic in it's nature and is not intended to
carry any product-specific payloads. It operates using the Generic API
Framework and the Function-specific Information and Operations.

## 4.5. High-Level Flow

Site Retrieval is part of a broader Cantata and Sonata End-to-End flow.
Figure 3. below shows a high-level diagram to get a good understanding of the
whole process and Site Retrieval's position within it.

![Figure 3. Cantata and Sonata End-to-End Flow](media/cantataSonataEndToEndFlowQuote.png)

**Figure 3. Cantata and Sonata End-to-End Function Flow**

- Address Validation:
  - Allows the Buyer to retrieve address information from the Seller, including
    exact formats, for addresses known to the Seller.
- Site Retrieval:
  - Allows the Buyer to retrieve Geographic Site information including exact
    formats for Geographic Sites known to the Seller.
- Product Offering Qualification (POQ):
  - Allows the Buyer to check whether the Seller can deliver a product or set
    of products from among their product offerings at the geographic address or
    a Geographic Site specified by the Buyer; or modify a previously purchased
    product.
- Quote:
  - Allows the Buyer to submit a request to find out how much the installation
    of an instance of a Product Offering, an update to an existing Product, or
    a disconnect of an existing Product will cost.
- Product Order:
  - Allows the Buyer to request the Seller to initiate and complete the
    fulfillment process of an installation of a Product Offering, an update to
    an existing Product, or a disconnect of an existing Product at the address
    defined by the Buyer.
- Product Inventory:
  - Allows the Buyer to retrieve the information about existing Product
    instances from Seller's Product Inventory.
- Trouble Ticketing:
  - Allows the Buyer to create, retrieve, and update Trouble Tickets as well as
    receive notifications about Incidents' and Trouble Tickets' updates. This
    allows managing issues and situations that are not part of normal
    operations of the Product provided by the Seller.

# 5. API Description

This section discusses the API structure and design patterns. It starts with
the high-level use cases diagram and then it describes the REST endpoints with
use case mapping.

## 5.1. High-level use cases

Figure 4 presents a high-level use case diagram as specified in MEF 79
[[MEF79](#8-references)] for Site Retrieval in section 7.1. This picture aims
to help understand the endpoint mapping. Use cases are described extensively in
[chapter 6](#6-api-interactions-and-flows).

**_Note:_** Use Cases keep the original numbering coming from MEF 79.

![Figure 4: High-level use cases](media/useCases.png)

**Figure 4: High-level use cases**

## 5.2. Resource/endpoint Description

### 5.2.1. Seller Side Endpoints

**Base URL for Cantata**:
`https://{{serverBase}}:{{port}}{{?/seller_prefix}}/mefApi/cantata/geographicSiteManagement/v1/`

**Base URL for Sonata**:
`https://{{serverBase}}:{{port}}{{?/seller_prefix}}/mefApi/sonata/geographicSiteManagement/v7/`

**_Note:_** All examples will include only the Sonata version of the Base Path.

Following endpoints are exposed by the Seller and allow the Buyer to:

- perform a query for a Geographic Site list
- get a single Geographic Site by `id`

The endpoints and corresponding data model are defined in
`productApi/serviceability/site/geographicSiteManagement.api.yaml`.

| API endpoint               | Description                                                                                                                                                        | MEF 79 Use case Mapping                   |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `GET /geographicSite`      | A request initiated by the Buyer to retrieve a list of `GeographicSites` from the Seller based on filter criteria provided as _`query`_                            | UC 3: Retrieve Service Site List          |
| `GET /geographicSite/{id}` | A request initiated by the Buyer to retrieve full details of a single `GeographicSite` based on on a Geographic Site identifier previously provided by the Seller. | UC 4: Retrieve Service Site by Identifier |

**[R1]** The Buyer implementation **MUST** be able to use both of the above
listed endpoints [MEF79 R1].

### 5.2.2. Specifying the Buyer ID and the Seller ID

A business entity willing to represent multiple Buyers or multiple Sellers must
follow requirements of MEF 79 [[MEF79](#8-references)] chapter 8.8, which
states:

> For requests of all types, there is a business entity that is initiating an
> Operation (called a Requesting Entity) and a business entity that is
> responding to this request (called the Responding Entity). In the simplest
> case, the Requesting Entity is the Buyer and the Responding Entity is the
> Seller. However, in some cases, the Requesting Entity may represent more than
> one Buyer and similarly, the Responding Entity may represent more than one
> Seller.
>
> While it is outside the scope of this specification, it is assumed that the
> Requesting Entity and the Responding Entity are aware of each other and can
> authenticate requests initiated by the other party. It is further assumed
> that both the Buying Entity and the Requesting Entity know:
>
> a) the list of Buyers the Requesting Entity represents when interacting with
> this Responding Entity;and  
> b) the list of Sellers that this Responding Entity represents to this
> Requesting Entity.

In the API the `buyerId` and `sellerId` are represented as query parameters in
each operation defined in `geographicSiteManagement.api.yaml`.

**[R2]** If the Requesting Entity has the authority to represent more than one
Buyer the request **MUST** include `buyerId` query parameter that identifies
the Buyer being represented [MEF79 R80].

**[R3]** If the Requesting Entity represents precisely one Buyer with the
Responding Entity, the request **MUST NOT** specify the `buyerId` [MEF79 R81].

**[R4]** If the Responding Entity represents more than one Seller to this Buyer
the request **MUST** include `sellerId` query parameter that identifies the
Seller with whom this request is associated [MEF79 R82].

**[R5]** If the Responding Entity represents precisely one Seller to this
Buyer, the request **MUST NOT** specify the `sellerId` [MEF79 R83].

## 5.3. API Resource Schema summary

This subchapter describes the resource model used by the API.

Each entity is a simple or composed type (with the use of `allOf` keyword for
data types composition). A simple type defines a set of properties that might
be of an object, primitive, or reference type.

[Section 6](#6-api-interactions-and-flows) provides examples of data model and
API usage. For a detailed description of the data model, please refer to
[API Details](#7-api-details).

Figure 5 presents the whole data model of the API.

![Figure 5: Data Model](media/siteModelNoErrors.png)

**Figure 5: Data Model**

**_Note:_** While showing the extends relation, for clarity, the extending type
lists only own attributes without the inherited ones.

**[R6]** If an entity is used in the payload, all properties marked as required
(\*) **MUST** be provided.

The root entity is the `GeographicSite`. It is used by both endpoints. Apart
from a few simple attributes it defines referential attributes:

- `relatedContactInformation` - to provide the details of the person or
  organization at the specific site location that is the local contact. This
  contact will primarily be used for gaining access to the site.
- `place` - a set of location descriptions, each of which describes where this
  Geographic Site is located.

**_Note:_** `place` is a set because a particular Geographic Site might be
described with multiple locations. For example, one Geographic Site might have
two Fielded Addresses (for a building on the corner of two streets). It also
can store several Address format representations of the same single Address.

The `place` can be specified with the use of `GeographicAddressRefOrValue`.
This means that a value representation of any of possible Address Types can be
provided, or a reference to already known (by `id`) Address.

**_Note:_** In MEF approach a `Site` cannot be a part of `Site` nor describes
it's `place`. That is why `GeographicAddressRef` is used instead of standard
`PlaceRef` - to ensure that a `Site` will not be used accidentally.

There are four possible types of address representation:

- `FieldedAddress`
- `FormattedAddress`
- `GeographicAddressLabel`
- `MEFGeographicPoint`

**[R7]** A Buyer **MUST** support at least one of Fielded Addresses or
Formatted Addresses to describe locations. [MEF79 R84]

**[R8]** A Seller **MUST** support at least one of Fielded Addresses or
Formatted Addresses to specify a location. [MEF79 R85]

The mandatory `@type` attribute of `GeographicAddressRefOrValue` is used as a
discriminator. It is possible for the Buyer and the Seller to go beyond those
four specified type. This can be done with the use of the `@schemaLocation`
attribute that will point to the schema defining the model of the new agreed
address representation. Using additional address schema must be bilaterally
agreed during the onboarding process.

### 5.3.1. Fielded Address

```json
{
  "@type": "FieldedAddress",
  "streetType": "ul.",
  "streetName": "Edmunda Wasilewskiego",
  "streetNr": "20",
  "streetNrSuffix": "14",
  "city": "Kraków",
  "stateOrProvince": "Lesser Poland",
  "postcode": "30-305",
  "country": "Poland",
  "geographicSubAddress": {
    "levelType": "floor",
    "levelNumber": "4"
  }
}
```

Example of a Geographic Address of type Fielded Address. The type discriminator
has the value `FieldedAddress`. A subset of available attributes is used to
describe the Geographic Address. The Fielded Address has an optional
`geographicSubAddress` structure that defines several attributes that can be
used in case precise address information has to be provided. In the example
above, a floor in the building at the given address is specified using this
structure.

### 5.3.2. Formatted Address

```json
{
  "@type": "FormattedAddress",
  "addrLine1": "ul. Edmunda Wasilewskiego 20/14",
  "addrLine2": "Floor 4",
  "city": "Kraków",
  "stateOrProvince": "Lesser Poland",
  "postcode": "30-305",
  "country": "Poland"
}
```

Geographic Address of type Formatted Address. The type discriminator has the
value `FormattedAddress`. This example contains the same information as the
previous `FieldedAddress` example.

### 5.3.3. Geographic Point

```json
{
  "@type": "MEFGeographicPoint",
  "spatialRef": "EPSG:4326 WGS 84",
  "x": "50.048868",
  "y": "19.929523"
}
```

Place information in a form of geographic point. `spatialRef` determines the
standard that has to be used to interpret coordinates provided in `x`
(latitude), `y` (longitude), and `z` (elevation) values.

This type allows only providing a point. It cannot carry more detailed
information like the floor number from previous examples.

**[R17]** The `spatialRef` value that can be used **MUST** be agreed upon
between Buyer and Seller during the onboarding process.

### 5.3.4. Geographic Address Label

```json
{
  "@type": "GeographicAddressLabel",
  "externalReferenceType": "CLLI",
  "externalReferenceId": "PLTXCL01"
}
```

The Geographic Address Label represents a unique identifier controlled by a
generally accepted independent Administrative Authority or standard
(`externalReferenceType`) that specifies a fixed geographical location. The
example above is a place that represents a CLLI (Common Language Location
Identifier) identifier which is commonly used to refer locations in North
America for network equipment installations.

## 5.4. Model Structural Validation

The structure of the HTTP payloads exchanged via Site Retrieval API endpoints
is defined in the OpenAPI document which is integral part of this standard.

**[R9]** Implementations **MUST** use payloads that conform to these
definitions.

## 5.5. Security Considerations

There must be an authentication mechanism whereby a Seller can be assured who a
Buyer is and vice-versa. There must also be authorization mechanisms in place
to control what a particular Buyer or Seller is allowed to do and what
information may be obtained. However, the definition of the exact security
mechanism and configuration is outside the scope of this document. It is being
worked on by a separate MEF Project (MEF W128).

# 6. API Interaction & Flows

This section provides a detailed insight into the API functionality, use cases,
and flows. First a list of business use cases is presented, followed by
examples and an explanation of all usage aspects involved.

Table 2 keeps the original use case numbering and naming from MEF 79. The
descriptions use API naming.

| Use Case # | Use Case Name                       | Use Case Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 3          | Retrieve Service Site List          | The Buyer requests that the Seller provides a list of `GeographicSites` known to the Seller based on a set of Geographic Site/Address filter criteria. For each `GeographicSite` returned, the Seller also provides a `GeographicSite.id`, which uniquely identifies it within the Seller. |
| 4          | Retrieve Service Site by Identifier | The Buyer requests the full details for a single `GeographicSite` based on a `GeographicSite.id` that was previously provided by the Seller.                                                                                                                                               |

**Table 2. Use cases description**

**_Note_**: The term "Seller Response Code" used in the Business Requirements
maps to HTTP response code, where `2xx` indicates _Success_ and `4xx` or `5xx`
indicate _Failure_.

## 6.1. Use case 3: Retrieve Service Site List

The flow is a simple request - response pattern, as presented on Figure 6:

![Figure 6: Use case 3: Retrieve Service Site List flow](media/useCase3Flow.png)

**Figure 6. Use case 3: Retrieve Service Site List flow**

The Buyer can retrieve a list of `GeographicSites` by using a
`GET /geographicSite` operation with desired filtering criteria.

The Buyer may search for Geographic Sites with use of following attributes:

- `companyName`
- `customerName`
- `description`
- `name`
- `serviceSiteContactName`
- `siteType`
- `geographicAddress.id`
- `streetNr`
- `streetName`
- `streetType`
- `city`
- `postcode`
- `country`

**[R10]** The Buyer **MUST** specify the Geographic Site Location either by
identifier - `geographicAddress.id` OR by value with use of `streetNr`,
`streetName`, `streetType`, `city`, `postcode`, `country`. [MEF79 R17]

**_Note:_** MEF 79 requires that the `streetName`, `city`, `postcode`, and
`country` are provided when the Unknown Address ID method is used [MEF79 R90].
However, for expected future use case enhancement the API does not mandates
those attributes to be populated, allowing for more open query (this will be
reflected in the future revisions of the Business Requirements Document). The
Seller is expected to return an `Error422` with `tooManyRecords` code if the
search criteria are to wide.

The example below shows a query that aims to find public (`siteType=public`)
`GeographicSites` available at known location with
`geographicAddress.id=00000000-0000-0030-0305-873500002014`.

```URL
https://seller.com/mefApi/sonata/geographicSiteManagement/v7/geographicSite?siteType=public&geographicAddress.id=00000000-0000-0030-0305-873500002014
```

After receiving the request, the Seller validates it. Then the Seller attempts
to match the Buyer's provided criteria with own Site information. The
determination of what is considered a match is at the Seller's discretion. If
the request filter criteria match one or more Sites known to the Seller, a
response is returned with the site information including an `id` for each
`Site` returned.

**[R11]** In case of no matching records found, the Seller **MUST** return a
valid `200` response with an empty list.

**[R12]** In case of too many matching records found (the definition of 'too
many' is up to Seller's discretion), the Seller **MUST** return an `Error422`
with `code` equal to `tooManyRecords`.

**[R13]** For each `GeographicSite` returned, the Seller **MUST** specify the
`GeographicSite.id` attribute. [MEF79 R23]

**[R14]** For each `GeographicSite` returned, the Seller MUST specify at least
one `place` using any of available Address Types. (Based on the default agreed
upon by this Buyer/Seller pair). [MEF79 R24]

Below you can find a response with 1 matching item:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "12340000-0000-0030-0305-873500002014",
    "href": "{{baseUrl}}/geographicSite/12340000-0000-0030-0305-873500002014",
    "description": "This is a description of the Site",
    "name": "Wasilewskiego Data Centre",
    "companyName": "Building Owner Co.",
    "customerName": "Data Centre Space Mgt Co.",
    "siteType": "public",
    "@type": "GeographicSite",
    "place": [
      {
        "@type": "GeographicAddressRef",
        "id": "00000000-0000-0030-0305-873500002014"
      }
    ],
    "relatedContactInformation": [
      {
        "emailAddress": "john.example@buildingowner.com",
        "name": "John Example",
        "number": "12-345-678-900",
        "organization": "Building Owner Co.",
        "role": "Building Owner Contact",
        "postalAddress": {
          "@type": "FieldedAddress",
          "streetNr": "20",
          "streetNrSuffix": "14",
          "streetName": "Edmunda Wasilewskiego",
          "city": "Kraków",
          "stateOrProvince": "Lesser Poland",
          "postcode": "30-305",
          "country": "Poland"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**_Note:_** Not having any `GeographicSite` provided for given Address does not
indicate if the Seller is able to serve any type of Product there. For the
Buyer to proceed with latter steps, it is sufficient to use the
`GeographicAddress`.

The business requirements of each of the use cases are described in sections
7.2, 8.2, and 8.10 of MEF 79 [[MEF79](#8-references)] and their updates in MEF
79.0.2 [[MEF79.0.2](#8-references)].

## 6.2. Use case 4: Retrieve Service Site by Identifier

To get detailed up to date information about the Site, the Buyer sends a
Retrieve Site by Identifier Request using a `GET /geographicSite/{id}`
operation.

The flow is a simple request - response pattern, as presented on Figure 7:

![Figure 7: Use case 4: Retrieve Service Site by Identifier flow](media/useCase4Flow.png)

**Figure 7. Use case 4: Retrieve Service Site by Identifier flow**

Example request and response:

`GET /mefApi/sonata/geographicSiteManagement/v7/geographicSite/00000000-0000-0030-0305-873500002014`

```json
[
  {
    "id": "56787654-0000-0030-0305-000000001234",
    "href": "{{baseUrl}}/geographicSite/56787654-0000-0030-0305-000000001234",
    "description": "This is a description of the Site",
    "name": "Main DC",
    "siteType": "public",
    "@type": "GeographicSite",
    "place": [
      {
        "@type": "GeographicAddressRef",
        "id": "11221122-0000-0030-0305-463795472461"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

**[R15]** In case `id` does not find a `GeographicSite` in Seller's system, an
error response `404` **MUST** be returned.

# 7. API Details

## 7.1. API patterns

### 7.1.1. Indicating errors

Erroneous situations are indicated by appropriate HTTP responses. An error
response is indicated by HTTP status 4xx (for client errors) or 5xx (for server
errors) and appropriate response payload. The Site retrieval API uses the error
responses depicted and described below.

Implementations can use http error codes not specified in this standard in
compliance with rules defined in RFC 7231 [[RFC7231](#8-references)]. In such
case the error message body structure might be aligned with the `Error`.

![Figure 8. Data model types to represent an erroneous response](media/siteErrorModel.png)

**Figure 8. Data model types to represent an erroneous response**

#### 7.1.1.1. Type Error

**Description:** Standard Class used to describe API response error Not
intended to be used directly. The `code` in the HTTP header is used as a
discriminator for the type of error returned in runtime.

#### 7.1.1.6. Type Error422

The response for HTTP status `422` is a list of elements that are structured
using `Error422` data type. Each list item describes a business validation
problem. This type introduces the `propertyPath` attribute which points to the
erroneous property of the request, so that the Buyer may fix it easier. It is
highly recommended that this property should be used, yet remains optional
because it might be hard to implement.

## 7.2. API Data model

Figure 9 presents the Site Retrieval data model. The data types, requirements
related to them, and mapping to MEF 79 and MEF 79.0.2 specifications are
discussed later in this section.

This data model is used to construct requests and responses of the API
endpoints described in [Section 5.2.1](#521-seller-side-endpoints)

![Figure 9. Site Retrieval Data Model](media/siteModelNoErrors.png)

**Figure 9. Site Retrieval Data Model**

### 7.2.1. Geographic Site

#### 7.2.1.1 Type GeographicSite

**Description:** A fixed physical location at which a Product can be installed.
Its location can be described either with geographic point (Lat/Long
information) or by association with an Address or Geographic Address Label.
This association may include a Sub-address describing where within that Address
or Geographic Address Label this particular Geographic Site is located.

The `role` attribute is used to provide a reason the particular party
information is used. It can result from MEF 79 requirements (e.g. Service Site
Contact) or from the Product Specification requirements.

The rule for mapping a represented attribute value to a `role` is to use the
_lowerCamelCase_ pattern e.g.

- business attribute name: "Service Site Contact": `role` must be
  `serviceSiteContact`

**_Note:_** MEF 79 does not define the `organization` and `postalAddress`
attributes. These are added for consistency with Quote and Order APIs.

**_Note:_** MEF 79 defines `numberExtension` as a required attribute, yet for
consistency with the rest of APIs it is defined as not required. This will be
addressed in anticipated revision of MEF 79.
