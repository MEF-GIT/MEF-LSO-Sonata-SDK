            An EVC End Point is a logical entity at a given UNI that is
            associated with a distinct set of frames passing over that UNI.
            EVC End Point Service Attributes are the attributes of an EVC that
            can be different at each UNI in the EVC. These are the EVC End
            Point Service Attributes applicable to Ethernet Private Line (EPL)
            Services defined in MEF 6.3 based on the Service Attributes in
            MEF 10.4.
