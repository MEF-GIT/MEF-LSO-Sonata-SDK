            A map for virtual frame mapping.   The absence of this attribute
            corresponds to a Service Attribute value of Not Applicable. Reference
            MEF 10.4 Section 9.3 Subscriber UNI Virtual Frame Map Service Attribute.

                    MEF 10.4 sec. 9.2 and sec. 9,3 - When the value of the Subscriber
                    UNI Instantiation Service Attribute = Virtual, there must exist
                    a map that maps the set of Virtual Frames that cross the UNI to
                    a sequence of pairs of the form〈s,t where s is a standard Ethernet
                    frame per Clause 3 of IEEE Std 802.3 – 2015 [5] and t is the arrival
                    time at the UNI for all bits in s. Since MEF 10.4 does not specify
                    the contents or format of this map, it is currently defined as
                    an arbitrary length string.
                type: string
                minLength: 0
