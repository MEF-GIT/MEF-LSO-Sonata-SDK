            MEF 10.4 sec. 10.4 - This is specifications for which Service
            Frames are mapped to the EVC End Point. The allowed values in MEF
            10.4 are ALL, LIST, and UT/PT. Since Private services must be ALL,
            the map isn't needed for those services, and therefore the type
            does not include ALL. If the type is LIST there must be a list
            of VLAN IDs specified.

            vlanType:

                    An indication of the type of EVC End Point Map. If the value
                    is UT/PT then no additional information is required. If the value
                    is LIST then a list of C-VLAN ID values must be specified.
