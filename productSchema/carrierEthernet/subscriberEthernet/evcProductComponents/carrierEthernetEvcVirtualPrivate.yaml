                    MEF 10.4 sec. 8.5 - The EVC C-Tag PCP Preservation Service
                    Attribute can be used to preserve the value of the PCP field in
                    C-Tagged Service Frames across an EVC. The value of the EVC C-Tag
                    PCP Preservation Service Attribute is either Enabled or Disabled.
                    *** Validation Notes: For Private Services this must be Enabled
                    so it is only included for Virtual Private Services.
