            These are the MEF 10.4 EVC Service Attributes that are common
            to all Subscriber (EVC-based) Ethernet Services defined in MEF
            6.3 based on the Service Attributes in MEF 10.4 - except EPL.

                    and Broadcast Frames are delivered by the service. For each, the
                    value can be UNCONDITIONAL, the frames are delivered without condition,
                    CONDITIONAL, the frames are delivered based on conditions agreed
                    to between Buyer and Seller (e.g., based on learned addresses),
                    and DISCARD. If CONDITIONAL is chosen for any of the elements,
                    the conditions must be agreed on by the Service Provider and Subscriber
                    by some other means. *** Validation Notes: For EPL this must be
                    unconditional for all 3 entries so not included

                    Bandwidth Profile Service Attribute is used to limit the rate of
                    all Egress Service Frames with a given Class of Service Name, as
                    determined at the ingress UNI for each frame per the EVC EP Ingress
                    Class of Service Map Service Attribute (MEF 10.4 Section 10.5).
                    The value of the EVC EP Class of Service Name Egress Bandwidth
                    Profile Service Attribute is either None or a non-empty list of
                    pairs of the form ⟨x, y⟩ where x is a Class of Service Name contained

                    are defined in MEF 10.4 Section 12.1.2. An empty list indicates
                    the value None.

                    Limit Service Attribute is either None or the pair ⟨N, t ⟩ where
