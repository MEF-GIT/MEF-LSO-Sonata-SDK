            The Bandwidth Profile Flow, BwpFlow, object class represents
            the Bandwidth Profile Flow which includes the bandwidth profile
            parameter CIR, CIRmax, CBS, EIR, EIRmax, EBS, Coupling Flag, Color
            Mode, Envelope and Rank, and Token Request Offset. The BwpFlow
            is used with Service Attributes for CarrierEthernetOperatorUni,
            CarrierEthernetSubscriberUni, CarrierEthernetVuni,, and ENNI as
            well as OVC and EVC End Points. Reference MEF 10.4 Section 12 and
            MEF 26.2 Section 17.

                    Flows), limits the average rate in bits per second at which External
