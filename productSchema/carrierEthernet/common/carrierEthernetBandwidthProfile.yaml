            The Bandwidth Profile Flow, BwpFlow, object class represents
            the Bandwidth Profile Flow which includes the bandwidth profile
            parameter CIR, CIRmax, CBS, EIR, EIRmax, EBS, Coupling Flag, Color
            Mode, Envelope and Rank, and Token Request Offset. The BwpFlow
            is used with Service Attributes for CarrierEthernetOperatorUni,
            CarrierEthernetSubscriberUni, CarrierEthernetVuni,, and ENNI as
            well as OVC and EVC End Points. Reference MEF 10.4 Section 12 and
            MEF 26.2 Section 17.

                    Committed Information Rate. When added to unused committed bandwidth
                    provided from higher-ranked Bandwidth Profile Flows (depending
                    on the value of couplingFlag for the higher-ranked Bandwidth Profile
                    Flows), limits the average rate in bits per second at which External
                    Interface Frames for this Bandwidth Profile Flow can be declared
                    Green.

                    Maximum Committed Information Rate. It limits the average rate
                    in bits per second at which External Interface Frames for this
                    Bandwidth Profile Flow can be declared Green (regardless of unused

                    Committed Burst Size. Limits by how much, and for how long, the
                    amount of traffic declared Green for this Bandwidth Profile Flow
                    in the short term can exceed the committed bandwidth made available

                    from higher-ranked Bandwidth Profile Flows, and to un-used committed
                    bandwidth (depending on the value of couplingFlag for this Bandwidth
                    Profile Flow and couplingFlagForIndexZero for the Envelope), limits

                    MEF 26.2 sec. 17.1.2 and MEF 10.4 sec. 12.1.2 - The couplingFlag
                    determines whether unused committed bandwidth for this Bandwidth
                    Profile Flow is made available as excess bandwidth for this Bandwidth
                    Profile Flow or as committed bandwidth for the next lower-ranked
                    Bandwidth Profile Flow. 0/FALSE means overflow green tokens are
                    used as green tokens in the next lowest BWP Flow in the Envelope.
                    1/TRUE means they are used as yellow tokens for this BWP Flow.

            Bandwidth Profiles are organized into Envelopes. Multiple Bandwidth
            Profiles in an envelope can share bandwidth resources. Each Envelope
            has a name and a Coupling Flag for Index Zero (CF0) that indicates
            whether unused green tokens are discarded or converted to yellow
            tokens. All Bandwidth Profile Flows in the same envelope satisfy
            the same criterion listed in R230 of MEF 26.2.

             For EVCs it is used by the EVC EP Class of Service Name Ingress
            Bandwidth Profile Service Attribute (MEF 10.4 sec. 10.9). and EVC
            EP Class of Service Name Egress Bandwidth Profile Service Attribute
