            The Bandwidth Profile Flow, BwpFlow, object class represents
            the Bandwidth Profile Flow which includes the bandwidth profile
            parameter CIR, CIRmax, CBS, EIR, EIRmax, EBS, Coupling Flag, Color
            Mode, Envelope and Rank, and Token Request Offset. The BwpFlow
            is used with Service Attributes for CarrierEthernetOperatorUni,
            CarrierEthernetSubscriberUni, CarrierEthernetVuni,, and ENNI as
            well as OVC and EVC End Points. Reference MEF 10.4 Section 12 and
            MEF 26.2 Section 17.

                    Committed Information Rate. When added to unused committed bandwidth
                    provided from higher-ranked Bandwidth Profile Flows (depending
                    on the value of couplingFlag for the higher-ranked Bandwidth Profile
                    Flows), limits the average rate in bits per second at which External

                    Green.

                    Maximum Committed Information Rate. It limits the average rate
                    in bits per second at which External Interface Frames for this
                    Bandwidth Profile Flow can be declared Green (regardless of unused

                    from higher-ranked Bandwidth Profile Flows, and to un-used committed
                    bandwidth (depending on the value of couplingFlag for this Bandwidth

                    Profile Flow is made available as excess bandwidth for this Bandwidth
                    Profile Flow or as committed bandwidth for the next lower-ranked
                    Bandwidth Profile Flow. 0/FALSE means overflow green tokens are
                    used as green tokens in the next lowest BWP Flow in the Envelope.

            whether unused green tokens are discarded or converted to yellow
            tokens. All Bandwidth Profile Flows in the same envelope satisfy

            EP Class of Service Name Egress Bandwidth Profile Service Attribute
