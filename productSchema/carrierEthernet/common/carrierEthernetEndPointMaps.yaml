            E (E for ENNI) consists of a list of one or more SVLAN ID values.
            An S-Tagged ENNI Frame whose S-VLAN ID value matches an entry in
            the list maps to the OVC End Point.

            MEF 10.4 sec. 16.5.2 - This map type is used when the OVC End
            Point is a Trunk OVC End Point (O-Tree services only). The value
            of an OVC End Point Map of Form T (T for Trunk) consists of a pair
            of S-VLAN ID values, ⟨r,l⟩ is called the Root S-VLAN ID value and
            l is called the Leaf S-VLAN ID value. An S-Tagged ENNI Frame whose
            S-VLAN ID value matches one of the two S-VLAN ID values in the
            OVC End Point Map Form T maps to the OVC End Point. Note that Form
            T differs from Form E because it distinguishes the role of each
            S-VLAN ID value.

            Frames are mapped to the EVC End Point. The allowed values in MEF
            10.4 are ALL, LIST, and UT/PT. Since Private services must be ALL,
            the map isn't needed for those services, and therefore the type
            does not include ALL. If the type is LIST there must be a list
            of VLAN IDs specified.
