    EndPointMapFormE:
        type: object
        description:  >-
            The value of an End Point Map of Form E (E for ENNI) consists
            of a list of one or more SVLAN ID values. An S-Tagged ENNI Frame
            whose S-VLAN ID value matches an entry in the list maps to the
            OVC End Point.
        properties:
            mapType:
                type: string
                enum:
                    - "FORM_E"

    EndPointMapFormT:
        type: object
        description:  >-
            The value of an OVC End Point Map of Form T (T for Trunk) consists
            of a pair of S-VLAN ID values, ⟨r,l⟩ is called the Root S-VLAN
            ID value and l is called the Leaf S-VLAN ID value. An S-Tagged
            ENNI Frame whose S-VLAN ID value matches one of the two S-VLAN
            ID values in the OVC End Point Map Form T maps to the OVC End Point.
            Note that Form T differs from Form E because it distinguishes the
            role of each S-VLAN ID value.
        properties:
    EndPointMapFormV:
        type: object
        description:  >-
            The value of an OVC End Point Map of Form V (V for VUNI) consists
            of one S-VLAN ID value and a list of one or more ENNI CE-VLAN ID
            values. An S-Tagged ENNI Frame whose S-VLAN ID value matches the
            S-VLAN ID value in the map and whose ENNI CE-VLAN ID value matches
            one of the ENNI CE-VLAN ID values in the map, maps to the OVC End
            Point.
        properties:
    EndPointMapFormU:
        type: object
        description:  >-
            The EndPointMapFormU object class represents the EVC/OVC End
            Point  Map Form U (U for UNI). It is a list of one or more CE-VLAN
            IDs.
        properties:
            mapType:
                type: string
                enum:

        description:  >-
            This is specifications for which Service Frames are mapped
            to the EVC End Point. The allowed values in MEF 10.4 are ALL, LIST,
            and UT/PT. Since Private services must be ALL, the map isn;t needed
            for those services, and therefore the type does not include ALL.
            If the type is LIST there must be a list of VLAN IDs specified.
        properties:
            vlanType:
                description: An indication about how the Vlan List argument is interpreted
                type: string
