            This is a 2-tuple ⟨x,y⟩ where x is a list of Port Conversation
            IDs or ranges of Port Conversation IDs (a Port Conversation ID
            is a VLAN ID or 0 for untagged frames) and y is a list of Link
            Numbers. This is used in the Port Conversation to Aggregation Link
            Map for the UNI and ENNI.
