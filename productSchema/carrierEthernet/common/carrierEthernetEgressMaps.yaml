            The PCP Field in the Egress EI Frame is determined from the
            Class of Service of the corresponding Ingress EI Frame. This is
            a list that contains an entry for Class of Service Name that includes
            the CoS Name and the PCP value  (or DISCARD) to use for that CoS.
            For example CoS=Platinum --> PCP = 6. This affects the C-tag at
            the UNI and the S-tag at the ENNI.
