            The Service Level Specification Service Attribute (SLS) is
            the technical details of the service level, in terms of Performance
            Objectives, agreed between the Service Provider and the Subscriber
            as part of the Service Level Agreement. A given SLS might contain
            0, 1, or more Performance Objectives for each Performance Metric.
            The SLS is described in section 8.8 (EVC Service Level Specification
            Service Attribute) of MEF 10.4 for EVCs and section 12.13 (OVC
            Service Level Specification Service Attribute) for OVCs. MEF 10.4
            defines 10 Performance Metrics (all of which are included here).
            MEF 26.2 defines only 9 Performance Metrics. MEF 26.2 does not
            include the One Way Composite PM. The other 9 are the same.

                    the date and time for the start of the SLS. It is the beginning
                    of the first timeInterval. This is referred to as ts in MEF 10.4
                    and MEF 26.2.

                    interval over which to evaluate the performance for the SLS. The
                    timeInterval (referred to as T in MEF 10.4 and 26.2) is a time
                    interval, e.g., 1 month, 2 weeks, that is used in conjunction with
                    startTime to specify time intervals for determining when Performance
                    Objectives are met. Note that the units for timeInterval are not
                    constrained; in particular, 1 month is an allowable value, corresponding
                    to a calendar month, e.g. from midnight on the 10th of one month
                    up to but not including midnight the 10th of the following month.

                    referred to as ∆tk (k is subscript).

            The One Way Group Availability Performance Metric has 2 parameters.
            The first parameter is a list of sets of Ordered End Point Pairs
            (referred to as G in the MEF Standards). (Note that this is different
            than the other Performance Metrics which have a list of Ordered
            End Point Pairs). The second parameter is the number of sets that
            must be available (referred to as K in the MEF Standards). The
            third element is the Performance Objective for the One Way Group
            Availability. See MEF 10.4 section 8.8.11 for EVC and MEF 26.2
            section 12.13.10 for OVC.

            Performance Metrics (except for Group Availability) are specified
            for a list of Ordered End Point Pairs. In other words a Frame Delay
            objective (for example) is specified from ⟨A to B⟩ and from ⟨C
            to D⟩. This class defines one Ordered End Point Pair.
