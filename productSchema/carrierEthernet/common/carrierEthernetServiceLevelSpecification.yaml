            The Service Level Specification Service Attribute (SLS) is
            the technical details of the service level, in terms of Performance
            Objectives, agreed between the Service Provider and the Subscriber
            as part of the Service Level Agreement. A given SLS might contain
            0, 1, or more Performance Objectives for each Performance Metric.
            The SLS is described in section 8.8 (EVC Service Level Specification
            Service Attribute) of MEF 10.4 for EVCs and section 12.13 (OVC
            Service Level Specification Service Attribute) for OVCs. MEF 10.4
            defines 10 Performance Metrics (all of which are included here).
            MEF 26.2 defines only 9 Performance Metrics. MEF 26.2 does not
            include the One Way Composite PM. The other 9 are the same.

                    and time for the start of the SLS. It is the beginning of the first

                    over which to evaluate the performance for the SLS. The timeInterval
                    (referred to as T in MEF 10.4 and 26.2) is a time interval, e.g.,
                    1 month, 2 weeks, that is used in conjunction with startTime to
                    specify time intervals for determining when Performance Objectives
                    are met. Note that the units for timeInternal are not constrained;
                    in particular, 1 month is an allowable value, corresponding to
                    a calendar month, e.g. from midnight on the 10th of one month up
                    to but not including midnight the 10th of the following month.

            Performance Metrics (except for Group Availability) are specified
            for a list of Ordered End Point Pairs. In other words a Frame Delay
            objective (for example) is specified from ⟨A to B⟩ and from ⟨C
            to D⟩. This class defines one Ordered End Point Pair.

            The Group Availability is specified for sets of Ordered End
            Point Pairs, e.g., G1=⟨⟨A,B⟩, ⟨A,C⟩⟩ and G2=⟨⟨A,D⟩, ⟨A,E⟩⟩. This
            class defines one set of Ordered End Point Pairs.
