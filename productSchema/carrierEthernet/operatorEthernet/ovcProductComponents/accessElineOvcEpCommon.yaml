                    the OVC End Point Envelopes Service Attribute can be used when
                    all of the Bandwidth Profile Flows contained in the Envelope are
                    specific to a given OVC End Point. They are specified using one
                    of the following OVC End Point Service Attributes: Ingress Bandwidth
                    Profile Per OVC End Point Egress Bandwidth Profile Per OVC End
                    Point Ingress Bandwidth Profile Per Class of Service Name Egress
                    Bandwidth Profile Per Egress Equivalence Class Name  To create
                    an Envelope containing Bandwidth Profile Flows for more than one
                    OVC End Point, the UNI or ENNI Envelopes Service Attribute (as
                    appropriate) must be used. If this is an empty list, then there
                    are no Envelopes defined at this End Point or the Envelopes are
                    defined at the external interface (UNI or ENNI). *** Validation
                    Notes: All Bandwidth Profile Flows in the specified envelopes must
                    be for this OVC End Point. The envelopIDs specified in this Service
                    Attribute must be unique with the envelopIDs specified in the UNI
                    or ENNI Envelopes Service Attribute (as appropriate for the OVC
                    End Point).

                    MEF 26.2 sec. 13.2 - A mapping of Port Conversation IDs (i.e.,
                    VLAN IDs) to an ordered list of physical links if EnniService.sVlanIdControl
                    is FULL and there are multiple physical links in the ENNI and EnniCommon.linkAggregation
                    is ALL_ACTIVE. Only S-VLAN IDs that are listed in the AccessElineOvcEndPoint.ovcEndPointMap
                    can be listed in this attribute.   If EnniService.sVlanIdControl
                    is PARTIAL then the Service Provider does not have full visibility
                    of all the S-VLAN IDs mapped to each physical link, and hence cannot
                    pick values that avoid overloading certain links. In this case,
                    the ENNI Port Conversation to Aggregation Link Map Common Attribute
                    must be agreed between the relevant Operators. *** Validation Notes:
                    This can only be specified for an OVC End Point at an ENNI. If
                    this is a non-empty list, then EnniService.sVlanIdControl must
                    be FULL and EnniCommon.linkAggregation must be ALL_ACTIVE.
