            This class contains all of the Access E-Line OVC Services Attributes.
            This class is used to compose the AccessElineOvc class.

                    MEF 26.2 sec. 12.6 - The max length in bytes allowed in a frame
                    mapped to an OVC EP associated by the OVC. The length of the frame
                    includes all bytes from the start of the destination MAC address
                    through the Frame Check Sequence. This must be at least 1526 (1518+C-tag+S-tag).
                    *** Validation Notes: This should be validated against maximum
                    frame size at the external interfaces. It must be less than or
                    equal to OperatorMultilateral.maximumFrameSizeMultilateral, and
                    It must less than OperatorUNI.maximumServiceFrameSize + 4 (for
                    an OVC with multiple UNIs, this is compared to the UNI with the
                    smallest maximum frame size.)

                    as well as the parameter values needed for the Performance Metric.

                    without condition, CONDITIONAL, the frames are delivered based
                    on conditions agreed to between Buyer and Seller (e.g., based on
                    learned addresses), and DISCARD. If CONDITIONAL is chosen for any
                    of the elements, the conditions must be agreed on by the Service
                    Provider and Operator by some other means.

                    is NONE there is no such level (that is, SOAM frames at all MEG
                    levels may be peered or discarded by the Service Provider). MEF
                    51.1 constrains it to 0-6 for Access E-Line.

                    C-tags (i.e. 1-4094) this must be CTA otherwise it must be CTB
