    Operator UNI Service Attributes describe the agreement between
    the Service Provider and the Operator of the behavior observable
    at the UNI. These are distinct from the Subscriber UNI Service
    Attributes that describe the agreement between an Ethernet Service
    (EVC) Subscriber and the Ethernet Service Provider. All of these
    Service Attributes can be modified after initial provisioning of
    the UNI except the components of the List of Physical Links  and
    Link Aggregation-related attributes.

    listOfPhysicalLinks:

            MEF 26.2 sec. 14.2, 14.3 - The value of the Operator UNI List
            of Physical Links Service Attribute is a list of UNIPhysicalLinks,
            one entry for each physical link that composes the UNI. UNIPhysicalLinks
            specifies several properties of the physical link such as the PHY
            type and the connector type.

            MEF 26.2 sec. 14.5 - Service Attribute representing Link Aggregation
            types. NONE-No Link Aggregation is used. 2_LINK_ACTIVE_STANDBY-The
            SP network uses Link Aggregation as in either Clause 5.6.1 of IEEE
            Std 802.1AX-2008 [2] or Clause 6.7.1 of IEEE Std 802.1AX-2014 with
            one Link Aggregation Group (LAG) across the links supporting the
            UNI such that all Service Frames are carried on only one of the
            two links when both links are operational. ALL_ACTIVE-The SP Network
            uses Link Aggregation as specified in Clause 5.3 of IEEE Std 802.1AX-2014,
            including the use of the version 2 LACPDUs as specified in Clause
            5.3.1h of IEEE Std 802.1AZ-2014, with one Link Aggregation Group
            (LAG) across the links. OTHER-The Operator/Subscriber/Service Provider
            agree on another other resiliency mechanism. *** Validation Notes:
            If the number of entries in OperatorUniCommon.listOfPhysicalLinks
            =  1: The value must be NONE 2: The value must be 2_LINK_ACTIVE-STANDBY,

            are multiple physical links in the UNI and the link aggregation

            of OperatorUniCommon.linkAggregation is not ALL_ACTIVE or OTHER.

            that covers all OVCs at the UNI. The value is either Disabled (empty
            array) or a BWP. *** Validation Notes: If this attribute includes
            a Bandwidth Profile Flow, then the OVC EPs at this UNI cannot have
            Ingress BWP Per OVC EP or Ingress BWP per CoS Name (consistent
            with R233 in MEF 26.2). This attribute MUST not be used for Access
            E-Line since that service requires Ingress BWP per CoS Name according
            to MEF 51.1.

            Disabled (empty array) or a BWP. *** Validation Notes: If this
            is specified then none of the OVC EPs at the UNI can have an Egress
            BWP per OVC EP or an Egress BWP per EEC Name (as this would break
            R233 in MEF 26.2).

            in the UNI if the UNI has more than one physical link (ENABLED)
            or not (DISABLED). *** Validation Notes: Must not be enabled if
            OperatorUNI.linkAggregation = NONE.

            Profile Envelopes containing more than one Bandwidth Profile Flow
            are supported by the Service Provider at the Operator UNI. ***
            Validation Notes: If this attribute is DISABLED, every Envelope
            at the UNI and every Envelope at the OVC End Point must contain
            at most 1 BWP Flow.

            list of {envelopeID, couplingFlagForIndexZero}. Note: Envelopes
            for the UNI can also be specified at the OVC End Points associated
            with the UNI.An empty list indicates that no Envelopes are defined
            at the UNI. *** Validation Notes: If the couplingFlagForIndexZero
            = 1 (TRUE) for this service attribute, then the couplingFlag for
            each Bandwidth Profile Flow in the Envelope must be 0 (FALSE).

            Passed). The value CTB or CTB2 must be used for port-based (private)
            services and CTA for vlan-based (virtual private) services. Per
            MEF 45.1: If an OVC has an OVC End Point at a UNI, then the value
            of the Operator UNI L2CP Address Set Service Attribute MUST be
            the same as the OVC L2CP Address Set Service Attribute. *** Validation
            Notes: If UniEP.ovcEndPointMap does not include all C-tags (i.e.
            1-4094) this must be CTA otherwise it must be CTB or CTB2. This
            value must be the same as AccessElineOvc.l2cpAddressSet.

            Service Attribute defined in MEF 45.1 specifies which protocols,
            if any, are peered at the UNI. The L2CP Peering service attribute
            value must be an empty list (if there are no peered Protocols),
            or a list of entries identifying protocols to be Peered where each
            entry consists of {Destination Address, Protocol Identifier} or
            {Destination Address, Protocol Identifier, Link Identifier}. ***

            must not have a Destination Address that is in Table 6 but not
            in the CTB subset of Table 6 in MEF 45.1.
