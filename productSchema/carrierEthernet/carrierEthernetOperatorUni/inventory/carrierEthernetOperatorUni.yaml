    Operator UNI Service Attributes describe the agreement between
    the Service Provider and the Operator of the behavior observable
    at the UNI. These are distinct from the Subscriber UNI Service
    Attributes that describe the agreement between an Ethernet Service
    (EVC) Subscriber and the Ethernet Service Provider. All of these
    Service Attributes can be modified after initial provisioning of
    the UNI except the components of the List of Physical Links  and
    Link Aggregation-related attributes.
