                    MEF 10.4 sec. 10.4 - The EVC EP Map Service Attribute is used
                    to map Service Frames to the EVC EP. The value of the EVC EP Map
                    Service Attribute (in MEF 10.4) is one of List, All, or UT/PT.
                    This attribute is only available for Virtual Private services since
                    Private services always require All. For Virtual Private Services
                    it can be UT/PT (Untagged/Priority Tagged) or UT/PT. When the value
                    of the EVC EP Map Service Attribute = List, a non-empty list of
                    unique integers, each in the range 1,2,…,4094 is specified.
                # This must be ALL for EPL, EP-LAN, EP-TREE Services, LIST or UT/PT for EVPxxx Services
                # See additional validation notes in the Schema Guide
