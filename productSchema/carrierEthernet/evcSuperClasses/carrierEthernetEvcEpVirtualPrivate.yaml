                    MEF 10.4 sec. 10.4 - The EVC EP Map Service Attribute is used
                    to map Service Frames to the EVC EP. The value of the EVC EP Map
                    Service Attribute (in MEF 10.4) is one of ALL, LIST, or UT/PT.
                    This attribute is only available for Virtual Private services since
                    Private services always require All. For Virtual Private Services
                    it can be UT/PT (Untagged/Priority Tagged) or LIST. When the value
                    of the EVC EP Map Service Attribute = List, a non-empty list of
                    unique integers, each in the range 1,2,…,4094 is specified.
                # This must be ALL for EPL, EP-LAN, EP-TREE Services, LIST or UT/PT for EVPxxx Services
                # See additional validation notes in the Schema Guide

                    The Envelopes and Envelope Coupling Flag values to which Bandwidth
                    Profile Flows for this EVC End Point can be mapped. Value is list
                    of {envelopeID, couplingFlagForIndexZero}. Envelopes listed in
                    the EVC End Point Envelopes Service Attribute can be used when
                    all of the Bandwidth Profile Flows contained in the Envelope are
                    specific to a given OVC End Point. They are specified using one
                    of the following EVC End Point Service Attributes: Ingress Bandwidth
                    Profile Per EVC End Point Egress Bandwidth Profile Per EVC End
                    Point Ingress Bandwidth Profile Per Class of Service Name Egress
                    Bandwidth Profile Per Egress Equivalence Class Name  To create
                    an Envelope containing Bandwidth Profile Flows for more than one
                    EVC End Point, the UNI Envelopes Service Attribute must be used.
