            The Service Level Specification Service Attribute (SLS) is,
            as part of the Service Level Agreement, the technical details of
            the service level, in terms of Performance Objectives, agreed between
            the Service Provider and the Subscriber for Subscriber Ethernet
            Services and between the SP/SO and Operator for Operator Ethernet
            Services. . A given SLS might contain 0, 1, or more Performance
            Objectives for each Performance Metric. The SLS is described in
            section 8.8 (EVC Service Level Specification Service Attribute)
            of MEF 10.4 for EVCs and section 12.13 (OVC Service Level Specification
            Service Attribute) for OVCs. MEF 10.4 defines 10 Performance Metrics
            (all of which are included here). MEF 26.2 defines only 9 Performance
            Metrics. MEF 26.2 does not include the One Way Composite PM. The
            other 9 are the same.

                    the date and time for the start of the SLS. It is the beginning
                    of the first timeInterval. This is referred to as ts in MEF 10.4
                    and MEF 26.2. The value is a string in ISO 8601 format.

                    (referred to as T in MEF 10.4 and 26.2) is a time duration, e.g.,
                    1 month, 2 weeks, that is used in conjunction with startTime to
                    specify time intervals for determining when Performance Objectives
                    are met. Note that the units for timeDuration are not constrained;
                    in particular, 1 month is an allowable value, corresponding to
                    a calendar month, e.g. from midnight on the 10th of one month up
                    to but not including midnight the 10th of the following month.

            than the other Performance Metrics which have a list of Ordered
            End Point Pairs). The second parameter is the number of sets that
            must be available (referred to as K in MEF 10.4 and MEF 26.2).
            The third element is the Performance Objective for the One Way
