    ColorFromDei:
        type: object
        description:  >-
            This Class is referenced when the color comes from the C-tag
            DEI field (for EVCs and OVCs) or the S-tag DEI field for OVCs.
            MEF 10.4 (EVCs) and  MEF 26.2 (OVCs) requires that DEI=0 means
            Green and DEI=1 means Yellow, so no map is needed.
        properties:
            mapType:
                type: string
                enum:

    ColorFromPCP:
        type: object
        description:  >-
            This Class is referenced when the color comes from the S-tag
            or C-tag PCP field. Each of the 8 possible PCP values maps to a
            color. If there is no tag, the frame is Green.

            This Class is referenced when the color comes from the DSCP
            field. It is a list of DSCP Entries where each entry has three
            components: (1) A list of DSCP values, (2) a color for IPv4 packets
            with one of those DSCP values, and (3) a color for IPv6 packets
            with one of those DSCP values. Any DSCP value that is not specified
            and any Frame that does not include an IP packet is Green..
