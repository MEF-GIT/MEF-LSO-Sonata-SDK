            The Bandwidth Profile Flow, BwpFlow, object class represents
            the Bandwidth Profile Flow which includes the bandwidth profile
            parameter CIR, CIRmax, CBS, EIR, EIRmax, EBS, Coupling Flag, Color
            Mode, Envelope and Rank, and Token Request Offset. The BwpFlow
            is used with Service Attributes for CarrierEthernetOperatorUni,
            CarrierEthernetSubscriberUni, CarrierEthernetVuni,, and ENNI as
            well as OVC and EVC End Points. Reference MEF 10.4 Section 12 and
            MEF 26.2 Section 17.

                    MEF 26.2 sec. 17.1.2 and MEF 10.4 sec. 12.1.2 - cir represents
                    Committed Information Rate. When added to unused committed bandwidth
                    provided from higher-ranked Bandwidth Profile Flows (depending
                    on the value of couplingFlag for the higher-ranked Bandwidth Profile
                    Flows), limits the average rate in bits per second at which External
                    Interface Frames for this Bandwidth Profile Flow can be declared
                    Green.

            cirMax:

                    MEF 26.2 sec. 17.1.2 and MEF 10.4 sec. 12.1.2 - cirMax represents
                    Maximum Committed Information Rate. It limits the average rate
                    in bits per second at which External Interface Frames for this
                    Bandwidth Profile Flow can be declared Green (regardless of unused
                    committed bandwidth from higher-ranked Bandwidth Profile Flows).

                    Committed Burst Size. Limits by how much, and for how long, the
                    amount of traffic declared Green for this Bandwidth Profile Flow
                    in the short term can exceed the committed bandwidth made available
                    to this Bandwidth Profile Flow over the long term, in bytes. ***
                    Validation Notes: If cir and/or cirmax are greater than 0, cbs
                    must be greater than 0. MEF 23.2 recommends that cbs should be
                    at least twice the Maximum Frame size (although in practice it
                    is usually quite a bit more than that).

                    Excess Information Rate. When added to unused excess bandwidth
                    from higher-ranked Bandwidth Profile Flows, and to un-used committed
                    bandwidth (depending on the value of couplingFlag for this Bandwidth
                    Profile Flow and couplingFlagForIndexZero for the Envelope), limits
                    the average rate in bits per second at which External Interface
                    Frames for this Bandwidth Profile Flow can be declared Yellow.

                    Maximum Excess Information Rate. It limits the average rate in
                    bits per second at which External Interface Frames for this Bandwidth
                    Profile Flow can be declared Yellow (regardless of unused excess
                    bandwidth from higher-ranked Bandwidth Profile Flows or unused
                    committed bandwidth).

                    amount of traffic declared Yellow for this Bandwidth Profile Flow
                    in the short term can exceed the excess bandwidth made available
                    to this Bandwidth Profile Flow over the long term. *** Validation
                    Notes: If eir and/or eirmax are greater than 0, ebs must be greater
                    than 0. Similar to cbs, ebs should be at least twice the Maximum
                    Frame size (although in practice it is usually quite a bit more
                    than that).

                    MEF 26.2 sec. 17.1.2 and MEF 10.4 sec. 12.1.2 - The couplingFlag
                    determines whether unused committed bandwidth for this Bandwidth
                    Profile Flow is made available as excess bandwidth for this Bandwidth
                    Profile Flow or as committed bandwidth for the next lower-ranked
                    Bandwidth Profile Flow. 0/FALSE means overflow green tokens are
                    used as green tokens in the next lowest BWP Flow in the Envelope.
                    1/TRUE means they are used as yellow tokens for this BWP Flow.
                    *** Validation Notes: This must be 0 (FALSE) if Envelope.couplingFlagForIndexZero

                    Notes: This must match an Envelope ID in exactly one of the Envelopes

            whether unused green tokens are discarded or converted to yellow
