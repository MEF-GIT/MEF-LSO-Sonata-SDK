            An Operator Multilateral Attribute is a behavior of a single
            Operator CEN at an ENNI that is externally visible to a Service
            Provider or Super Operator using that CEN and ENNI and/or to peer
            Operators operating CENs on the other side of the ENNI. An Operator
            Multilateral Attribute has the same value for all Service Providers
            or Super Operators using that CEN and ENNI to whom the behavior
            is externally visible.

                    MEF 26.2 sec. 10.2 and MEF 45 sec. 8.3 - Reflects the capability
                    of the ENNI to process S-VLAN-tagged L2CP Frames in an 802.1 compliant
                    manner. The allowed values are “802_1_COMPLIANT” or “802_1_NON_COMPLIANT”.
                    A value of 802_1_COMPLIANT means the ENNI will apply the special
                    forwarding rules to Tagged L2CP ENNI Frames that map to a VUNI
                    or an OVC End Point supporting a service other than EPL with EPL
                    Option 2 L2CP processing. A value of 802_1_NON_COMPLIANT means
                    the ENNI will pass any Tagged L2CP ENNI Frames. There is an ENNI
                    Tagged L2CP Frame Processing Multilateral Attribute for each ENNI.
                # MEF 51.1 indicates that the value SHOULD be 802_1_COMPLIANT
