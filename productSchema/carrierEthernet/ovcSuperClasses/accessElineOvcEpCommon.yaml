            This class contains all of the Access E-Line OVC End Point
            Services Attributes that are used in all four Business Functions
            (POQ, Quote, Order, Inventory). At this time, this includes all
            of the Access Eline OVC End Point Service Attributes. This class
            is used to compose the AccessElineOvcEndPoint class which has one
            file for each Business Function that differ in terms of the Service
            Attributes that are "Required" for the Business Function (rather
            than "Optional").
