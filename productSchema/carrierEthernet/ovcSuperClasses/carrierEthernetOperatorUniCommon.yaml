            This class contains all of the Operator UNI Services Attributes.
            This class is used to compose the OperatorUNI class.

                description:  >-
                    MEF 26.2 sec. 14.2, 14.3 - This Service Attribute combines
                    several of the MEF 26.2 Objects into a single n-tuple that is consistent
                    with the way this information is described in MEF 10.4. The value
                    of the Operator UNI List of Physical Links Service Attribute is
                    a list of 6-tuples of the form ⟨id, physicalLink, synchronousEthernet,
                    precisionTiming, uniConnectorType,uniConnectorGender⟩, with one
                    list item for each physical link. The value of id is an identifier
                    for the physical link. The value of physicalLink is the specific
                    Ethernet physical layer type. synchronousEthernet indicates if
                    synchronous Ethernet is used on the physical link and has the value
                    Enabled or Disabled. The value of precisionTiming indicates if
                    the Precision Time Protocol is used on the physical link and has
                    the value Enabled or Disabled. The values of uniConnectorType and
                    uniConnectorGender specify the type of connector used. Note that
                    the id and the physicalLink come from the CarrierEthernetPhysicalLink
                    class.

                    types. NONE-No Link Aggregation is used. 2_LINK_ACTIVE_STANDBY-The
                    SP network uses Link Aggregation as in either Clause 5.6.1 of IEEE
                    Std 802.1AX-2008 [2] or Clause 6.7.1 of IEEE Std 802.1AX-2014 with
                    one Link Aggregation Group (LAG) across the links supporting the
                    UNI such that all Service Frames are carried on only one of the
                    two links when both links are operational. ALL_ACTIVE-The SP Network
                    uses Link Aggregation as specified in Clause 5.3 of IEEE Std 802.1AX-2014,
                    including the use of the version 2 LACPDUs as specified in Clause
                    5.3.1h of IEEE Std 802.1AZ-2014, with one Link Aggregation Group
                    (LAG) across the links. OTHER-The Operator/Subscriber/Service Provider
                    agree on another other resiliency mechanism.
