            For each instance of an ENNI, there are multiple sets of ENNI
            Service Attributes. The value for each ENNI Service Attribute in
            a set for an Operator CEN is specific to a SP/SO that is using
            the ENNI per Section 8.11 of MEF 26.2. Each such value is agreed
            to by the SP/SO and the Operator.

                description:  >-
                    MEF 26.2 sec. 13.2 - The value of the S-VLAN ID Control Service
                    Attribute is FULL or PARTIAL. When the value is FULL, the Operator
                    can support only a single SP/SO at the ENNI. In other words, S-VLAN
                    IDs at the ENNI can only be mapped to OVC End Points for a single
                    SP/SO. When the value is PARTIAL, there can be multiple SP/SOs
                    using the ENNI and different S-VLAN IDs can be mapped to OVC End
                    Points for different SP/SOs.
                type: string
                enum:

                    MEF 26.2 sec. 13.3 - The value of the Maximum Number of OVCs
                    Service Attribute is a strictly positive integer. It provides an
                    upper bound on the number of OVCs that the Operator will support
                    at the ENNI for the SP/SO.

                    MEF 26.2 sec. 13.4 - Usually each OVC has a single End Point
                    at the ENNI but with hairpin switching an OVC can have multiple.
                    This Service Attribute sets the limit on the number of End Points
                    an OVC can have at the ENNI.

                    Profile Envelopes containing more than one Bandwidth Profile Flow
                    are supported by the Service Provider at the ENNI.

                    values to which Bandwidth Profile Flows can be mapped. Value is
                    list of {envelopeID, couplingFlagForIndexZero}. Note: Envelopes
                    for the ENNI can also be specified at the OVC End Points associated
                    with the ENNI.
