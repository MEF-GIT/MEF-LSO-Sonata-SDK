title: MEF LSO Legato - IP Service Level Specification
description:
  This schema gathers definitions related IP Service Level Specification. The
  root type is IpSls which in context of MEF 139 is specified to
  InternetAccessSls due to specific requirements and put into
  productSchema/ip/internetAccess/internetAccessCommon.yaml. The original IpSls
  definition is not needed and thus is missing in this file.

      a four-tuple of the form (s, T, E, L) where s is the start time, T is a
      period of time, E is a set of SLS entries, and L is a set of locations as
