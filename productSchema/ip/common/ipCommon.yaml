      - NONE: No BFD authentication.
      - SIMPLE_PASSWORD: Simple Password Authentication is the most 
      straightforward (and weakest) form of authentication. In this method
      of authentication one or more Passwords (with corresponding Key IDs) 
      are configured in each system and one of these Password/ID pairs is 
      carried in each BFD Control packet. The receiving system accepts the

      pairs configured in that system. Reference IETF RFC5880 Section 6.7.2.
      - KEYED_MD5: The Keyed MD5 and Meticulous Key MD5 Authentication

      - METICULOUS_KEYED_MD5: The Keyed MD5 and Meticulous Key MD5 
      Authentication mechanisms are very similar to those used in other

      Reference RFC5880 Section

      mechanisms are very similar to those used in other protocols. In 
      these methods of authentication, one or more secret keys (with 
      corresponding key IDs) are configured in each system. Reference
