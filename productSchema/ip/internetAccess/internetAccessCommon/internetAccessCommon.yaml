      one Class of Service Name, exactly one IPVC End Point at the UNI and
      exactly one UNI Access Link, none of the other options are needed. There
      can also be one flow, so the `flowIdentifier` and `weight` are also
      omitted for the flow. `maxIr` is omitted from the Envelope - resulting in
      flattened BasicIaBwpEnvelope class containing four attributes: the
      Envelope IR Time `tE`, and the `cir`, `maxIr` and `burstBehavior` for the
      single BWP Flow. This special case envelope is used for the UNI, IPVC End
