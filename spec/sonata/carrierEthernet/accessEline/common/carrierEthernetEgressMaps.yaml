            The PCP Field in the Egress EI Frame is determined from the
            Class of Service. This is a list that contains exactly one entry
            for each Class of Service Name and the PCP value  (or DISCARD)
            to use for that CoS. For example CoS=Platinum --> PCP = 6. This
            affects the C-tag at the UNI and the S-tag at the ENNI.
