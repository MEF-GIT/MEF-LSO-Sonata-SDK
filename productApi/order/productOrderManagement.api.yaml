This is a terminal state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
        | `held`                | HELD          | The Product Order Item cannot be progressed due to Charge the Seller awaiting a response from the Buyer on a Charge. The Seller stops work on the Product Order Item until the Charge has completed. Upon acceptance by the Buyer of all Blocking charges, the Product Order Item returns to `inProgress` state If the Buyer rejects a Blocking charge, the Product Order Item moves to the `failed` state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
        | `inProgress`          | IN_PROGRESS   | The Product Order Item has been successfully validated and fulfillment has started. If the Seller's system links validation between Product Order Items in a Product Order, a Product Order Item in this state also indicates that the other Product Order Items passed validation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

The Seller stops work on the Product Order Item until either the Cancel Product Order has been accepted and the Product Order state moves to `pendingCancellation` and the Product Order Item state moves to `cancelled`, the Cancel Product Order has been rejected and the Product Order Item State moves to `inProgress`, the Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date has been accepted and the Product Order Item State moves to `inProgress`, or the Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date moves to `done.declined` and the Product Order Item state moves to `inProgress` with original delivery dates. |

        | `acknowledged`                  | ACKNOWLEDGED           | A Product Order has been received by the Seller and has passed basic validation. A `productOrder.id` is assigned in the `acknowledged` state and a response is returned to the Buyer. The Product Order remains in the `acknowledged` state while validations of Product Order and Product Order Item(s) attributes as applicable is completed. If the Product Order and Product Order Item attributes are validated the Product Order moves to the `inProgress` state. If not validated, the Product Order moves to the `rejected` state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
        | `assessingCancellation`         | ASSESSING_CANCELLATION | A Cancel Product Order request has been received by the Seller. The Product Order is being assessed to determine if the Product Order can be cancelled. If there are charges associated with cancelling the Product Order, these are communicated to the Buyer using the Charge process. The Product Order remains in the `assessingCancellation` state until any relevant Charge is completed or withdrawn by the Seller. Once the Buyer's request has been validated and any associated Charges completed, the Product Order moves to the `pendingCancellation` state. If the request is not validated or if any associated Charges are not completed, the Product Order moves to the `inProgress` state and the Product Order is not cancelled.                                       |
        | `held.assessingCharge`          | ASSESSING_CHARGE       | A Charge has been initiated by the Seller that is not the result of a Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date or Cancel Product Order request and the Seller is awaiting a Buyer response to the Charge. If a blocking or non-blocking charge is accepted by the Buyer, the Product Order moves to `inProgress`. If a non-blocking charge is declined by the Buyer, the Product Order moves to `inProgress`. If a blocking charge is declined by the Buyer and there are no unrelated Product Order Items in the Product Order, the Product Order moves to the `inProgress` and then to the `failed` state. If a blocking charge is declined by the Buyer and there are unrelated Product Order Items in the Product Order, the Product Order moves to the `inProgress` state. |
        | `pending.assessingModification` | ASSESSING_MODIFICATION | A request has been made by the Buyer to modify either the `expediteIndicator` or the `requestedCompletionDate` of a Product Order Item. The Product Order Item is currently being assessed to determine whether the Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date is valid. If there is a charge associated with the Modify Product Order Item Requested Delivery Date, the Product Order remains in the `pending.assessingModification` state until the Charge is completed or withdrawn by the Seller. Once the Buyer's request has been validated and any associated Charges completed, the Product Order returns to the `inProgress` state.                                                                                                                                      |
        | `cancelled`                     | CANCELLED              | The Product Order has been successfully cancelled. This is a terminal state.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
        | `pendingCancellation`           | CANCELLING             | The Buyer's Cancel Request has been assessed and it has been determined that it is feasible to proceed with the cancellation. This state can also result from a Seller cancelling the Product Order within their systems without a request from the Buyer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

        relationshipType:
          description: >
            Specifies the type (nature) of the relationship to the related
            Product. The nature of required relationships varies for Products
            of different types. For example, a UNI or ENNI Product may not have
            any relationships, but an Access E-Line may have two mandatory
            relationships (related to the UNI on one end and the ENNI on the
            other). More complex Products such as multipoint IP or Firewall
            Products may have more complex relationships. As a result, the
            allowed and mandatory `relationshipType` values are defined in the
            Product Specification.

      description: |
        Contact information of an individual or organization playing a role for

        `role` is to use the _lowerCamelCase_ pattern e.g. 
        - Buyer Order Item Contact: `role=buyerOrderItemContact` 
        - Buyer Implementation Contact: `role=buyerImplementationContact` 
        - Buyer Technical Contact: `role=buyerTechnicalContact`
