    This API allows to retrieve a list of Geographic site and to get all
    information for one geographic site.


    A geographic site is a fixed physical location at which a Product can be
    installed. Its location can be

    described either with geocoding (Lat/Long information) or by association
    with an Address or Address Reference.
